### Chapter Title: *The Universal Language*

Math as the universal model for knowledge representation
=====

The mathematics of set theory and graph theory provide the foundation from which language can be constructed.
-----

In the previous section we argued that decentralized linguistic consensus requires two prerequisites: 1) a universal model for knowledge representation and 2) a rudimentary web of trust. The universal model must be as simple as possible and devoid of any *arbitrary* decisionss. There must be at least a rudimentary method for web of trust, so that arbitrary decisions can be influenced greatly by, if not completely absorbed from, those around us.

We argue that the only universal language to satisfy those conditions is mathematics. In particular: set theory and graph theory.
