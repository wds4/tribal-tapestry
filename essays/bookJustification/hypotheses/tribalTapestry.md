Tribal Tapestry
=====

# List of Hypotheses

## 1. [Oh Shit, We Have Enemies!](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/humanConditionHypothesis.md)
The human condition -- the fact that we have enemies -- drives a new twist in how the brain operates.

## 2. [The Other]()
The formation of tribes requires rejection of The Other.

## 3. [The Tribal Narrative Fiction]()
Tribes are defined by the tribal narrative, and in particular by the Narrative Fiction.

## 4. [Tribal Superposition]()
Tribal narratives, and therefore tribes themselves, layer on top of one another in the same way that languages do.

## 5. [Proof of Loyalty]()
Toxicity serves a purpose: proof of loyalty to the tribe.

## 6. [Virtue Signals]()
Virtue Signals demonstrate proof of loyalty and weave new toxic threads into the narrative fiction, resulting in evolution of the narrative fiction.

## 7. [There's Truth, and Then There's "Truth," and Never the Twain Shall Meet](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/dualModeHypothesis.md)
Basic human cognition employs two distinct modes to arrive at what it considers "truth:" the objective mode and the tribal mode.

## 8. [Ambiguity and Equivocation]()
Ambiguity enables *equivocation*, which is the basic building block of most if not all logical fallacies.

## 9. [Proof of Work]()
Tapestry theory allows us to appreciate the computational expense required to minimize the damage caused by toxic threads. The amount of work required by any given tribe can be seen to adjust up or down based upon factors that remain unknown.

## 10. [Evolution of the Tribal Narrative]()
Competition among the tribal elite can spur changes to the tribal narrative.

## 11. [Da Vince versus Derrida](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/postmodernismHypothesis.md)
The Enlightenment and postmodernism represent the triumph of the objective mode and the tribal mode, respectively. But each approach suffers due to a failure to appreciate the purpose of the opposing cognitive mode.

## 12. [That Which Shall Not Be Named](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/primeDirectiveHypothesis.md)
Tribal Tapestry Theory is universally toxic; the Prime Directive commands us to reject the very vocabulary required to discuss it.

## 13. [Look at me: I am the Web of Trust Now]()
Tribalism distorts the web of trust and replaces decentralized influence with centralized power.

## 14. [The Mystery of Majesty]()
There is a spiritual need for mystery, paradox, and saviour that was left unfulfilled by the Enlightenment.

## 15. [A New Way]()
Can we minimize the toxicity required to maintain tribal coherence? Can we create an Enlightenment Part 2, but in a way that does not leave spiritual needs unmet?
