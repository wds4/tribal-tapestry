The basic hypothesis of this book will be called the Dual Cognitive Modes hypothesis and will be summarized as follows.

## The DCM hypothesis, in one sentence

The brain of the social animal, including (but not limited to) humans, has two cognitive modes of operation: the *default cognitive mode* and the *social cognitive mode*. 

## Elaboration of the DCM hypothesis

The two cognitive modes differ in three fundamental ways: why, what, and when.

## Why
- The purpose of the default cognitive mode is to maintain a representation of the world that is accurate and relevant.
- The purpose of the social mode is to gain acceptance by the tribe

## WHen
- The default mode is active always, by default, UNLESS it is overridden by the social mode.
- The social mode overrides the default mode ONLY when required to do so by the tribal narrative. Since every tribe has a distinct narrative fiction, when this mode kicks in is HIGHLY CONTEXTUAL.

## how
- default mode: it doesn't actually matter how it works; it is what it is [1]
- social mode: demonstrations of loyalty to the trib(s) by performance of virtue signals

## Virtue signals

The purpose of a virtue signal is to demonstrate the internalization of tribal toxicity.

## Toxic threads

A toxic thread is defined as one that would be rejected by the default cognitive mode.

## Don't Know Thyself

An auxiliary hypothesis of this book is the Prime Directive, which is to deny the full extent of the social cognitive mode in oneself and in one's tribe, despite an exquisite sensitivity to its presence in The Other. In other words, be ignorant of the dual hypothesis. The primary method is to erase the very words that are used to communicate the hypothesis. Adherence to the Prime Directive is neuro-normative behaviour, while Deviation from the Primae Directive is one form of neuroatypical.

[1] We add an *auxiliary* hypothesis that this is how the default cognitive mode works: reliance on observation, consistency, rules of logic; what some humans would call "the scientific method." But the Dual Cognitive Modes hypothesis doesn't actually require us to specify how it works. It is what it is; and however it works, *the social mode is defined by its context-dependent opposition to the default mode*.
