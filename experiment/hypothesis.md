# The Hypothesis in One Sentence

**The brain of the social animal, including (but not limited to) humans, has two cognitive modes of operation: the *standard cognitive mode* and the *social (tribal) cognitive mode***. 

# Definition of Terms

A full understanding of the hypothesis requires an understanding of the words used to state it.

## Cognitive Modes

The two cognitive modes differ in three fundamental ways: why, when, what

### Why
- The purpose of the standard cognitive mode is to maintain a model of the world that is *useful*, as judged by the individual.
- The purpose of the social cognitive mode is to gain acceptance by the tribe; to *belong*.

### When
- The standard cognitive mode is ALWAYS in control, in EVERY context, by default, UNLESS it is overridden by the social cognitive mode.
- The social cognitive mode overrides the standard cognitive mode ONLY when required to do so by the tribal narrative fiction. Since every tribe has its own unique and distinctive narrative fiction, when this mode kicks in is only in very particular, highly specific *contexts*, SPECIFIC TO THE TRIBE.

### What / How
- standard cognitive mode: data is acquired by the senses and processed using algorithms shaped (presumably) by evolution, and which we refer to as *logic*
- social cognitive mode: demonstrations of loyalty to the tribe by the performance of virtue signals

## Virtue signals

The purpose of a virtue signal is to broadcast / demonstrate / shout from the mountaintops (to tribal insiders AND outsiders) that the tribal narrative fiction has been woven irreversibly into one's brain.

## Tribal Narrative

The Tribal Narrative is defined as a vast collection of stories, beliefs, values, expectations, language, rules, roles, laws, etc, all loosely woven and integrated together into a tapestry according to the tapestry model of knowledge representation. Most threads of the tribal narrative as a whole are not (necessarily) toxic.

## Tribal narrative fiction

A small subset of the greater Tribal Narrative, consisting of *toxic threads*, woven into a pattern that is unique to the tribe and that serves to distinguish one tribe from another.

## Toxic threads

Toxicity is defined by its opposition to the normal operations of the standard mode, no matter what those may be. A *toxic* thread is defined as a particular thought or idea (a thread), the incopporation of which incurs a *cost* to the individual via interference with the normal functioning of the standard cognitive mode. Toxicity is usually achieved either by contradicting observation or engaging in logical fallacy. By definition, a toxic thread is one that would normally be automatically rejected / removed by the usual operations of the standard cognitive mode.

## The game theory for why this system makes sense

Incorporation of a toxic thread into one's psyche is a costly act of self sacrifice that is hard to fake, hard to undo, and diminishes the feasibility of defecting to enemy tribes. This makes it simultaneously an _indicator_ and an _enforcement mechanism_ of tribal loyalty.
