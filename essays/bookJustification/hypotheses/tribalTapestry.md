# List of Hypotheses

## 1. [Oh Shit, We Have Enemies.](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/humanConditionHypothesis.md)
The human condition -- the fact that we have enemies -- drives a new twist in how the brain operates.

## 2. [Exclusion is necessary.]()
The formation of tribes requires rejection of The Other.

## 3. [Proof of Loyalty](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/functionOfToxicityHypothesis.md)
Toxicity serves a purpose: proof of loyalty to the tribe.

## 4. [There's Truth, and Then There's Truth.](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/dualModeHypothesis.md)
Basic human cognition employs two distinct modes to arrive at what it considers "truth:" the objective mode and the tribal mode.

## 5. [Take Your Pick](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/postmodernismHypothesis.md)
The Enlightenment and postmodernism represent the rejection of the tribal mode and the objective mode, respectively.

## 6. [Prime Directive Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/primeDirectiveHypothesis.md)
Tribal Tapestry Theory is universally toxic and commands us to erase the vocabulary required to discuss it.
