<h1 align="center" >Virtue Signals: Definition and Description</h1>

# Motivation

The primary motivaiton of engaging in virtue signaling is to broadcast allegiance to the tribe. The need to be accepted, the fundamental need to _belong_, is what motivates the creation and propagation of most virtue signals. In some cases, people may use virtue signaling to test someone else's allegiance to the tribe. But more often it is the case that people use virtue signals to broadcast their own allegiance to the tribe.

# Mechanism

One demonstrates loyalty to the tribe via one's response to a virtue signal. In effect, a virtue signal is a litmus test with a binary outcome. It is a collection of attractive and toxic ideas that are bundled together into a package deal, and one is expected either to endorse them (the entire package) or to reject them.

# Components and features

Virtue signals can be identified in the wild by these features:

### Primary features
- a universally acceptible *core* (ideas, values, etc that are typically acceptable to the standard cognitive mode, so that most or all people would agree with them, regardless of tribal affiliation)
- a toxic *overlay* (e.g. hypocrisy or unfalsifiable assertions of fact, typically unacceptable to the standard cognitive mode) that is _unpalatable_, possibly _irritating_ to anyone who does not identify with the tribe
- the *union* of the core with the overlay (an argument that acceptance of the core and the overlay must be a package deal. This argument is included within the toxic overlay.)

### Secondary features
- the challenge: a social scenario in which the VS is presented to an individual, who has the opportunity to provide a reaction and may be expected to do so
- binary responses: an individual demonstrates acceptance or rejection of the VS
- calibration (acceptance of the overlay needs to incur a cost that is not too high and not too low, the determination of which is encoded into the tribal narrative fiction; analogous to the *difficulty adjustment* of the proof of work consensus mechanism)

# Standard Binary Responses:

There are two factors to consider when evaluating a subject's response to the challenge.
- Does the subject attend to (versus ignore) the core, the toxicity, or both?
- Does the subject endorse or reject the virtue signal?
- Does the subject attempt to separate the core from the overlay, or bind them together more tightly?

The virtuous subject: a sense of _moral superiority_; draws attention to and endorses the core; ignores vs endorses the toxicity; endorses the virtue signal as a whole; and resists any attempt to disentangle the core and the overlay.

The Other: _irritation_; draws attention to the toxicity and rejects the VS on those grounds; ignores vs endorses the core in isolation; rejects the virtue signal as a whole; and (if sufficiently motivated and prepared) may attempt to disentangle the core and the overlay, so that the core can be accepted while the overlay is rejected.

# Nonstandard responses

One potential response that does not fit into either of the above categories and that is worth noting would be the subject who _trandscends_ the test. In this case, the subject is *successfully* able to disentangle the core and the overlay. This is nonstandard because virtue signals will not propagate through the community unless disentanglement is sufficiently difficult to achieve, so difficult that it is normally not worth the cognitive effort. The ability to do this successfully generally requires advanced preparation, with detailed knowledge of the virtue signal and the tribal tapestry in which it is embedded.

# Why this makes sense

The purpose of binding the core and the overlay together is to make them effectively a package deal. You are forced to make a choice: endorse the core at the price of endorsing the toxic overlay, or reject the toxic overlay at the price of rejecting the core along with it.
