The Foundations of Tapestry Theory
=====

## 1. [Decentralized Linguistic Consensus](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/decentralizedLinguisticConsensus.md)
The purpose of tapestry theory is to provide a solution to the problem of *decentralized linguistic consensus*: how to build a language without leaders.

## 2. [Math as the universal model for knowledge representation](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/schellingPointHypothesis.md)
The mathematics of set theory and graph theory provide the foundation from which decentralized language can be constructed.

## 3. [Knowledge is represented using a graph](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/graphHypothesis.md)
Knowledge is broken down into small chunks, called *nodes*, which are connected by *edges*, thus forming a graph, a.k.a. the *tapestry*.

## 4. [The nodes of the concept graph can be any chunk of data](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/nodeFlexibilityHypothesis.md)
The need for decentralized linguistic consensus requires that the tapestry model should place no restrictions on the physical structure or data format of individual nodes in the graph.

## 5. [In the biological realm, nodes are patches of neurons](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/biologicalNodesAreNeuronsHypothesis.md)
Nodes in the cortex are patches of neurons.

## 6. [Principles of Organization (PoA)](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/principlesOfOrganization.md)
The SLC exerts pressure to make the *principles of organization* of the graph as simple and universal as possible.

## 7. [PoA 1: Class Threads](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/classThreadsHypothesis.md)
Nodes of the graph are organized into sets and concepts using class threads.

## 8. [PoA 2: Pattern Recognition](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/constraints.md)
Concepts are formatted according to constraint nodes.

## 9. [Information Integration](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/integrationMaximizationHypothesis.md)
There is evolutionary pressure for the tapestry to be integrated as tightly and extensively as possible.

## 10. [Vertical Integration](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/verticalIntegrationHypothesis.md)
Concepts are integrated vertically using the class propagation edge and the class termination edge (2 of the 3 edges that go into the definition of class threads).

## 11. [Horizontal Integration](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/objectHypothesis.md)
Constraint nodes are decomposed into properties in a manner designed to facilitate and maximize horizontal integration of the graph.

## 12. [The Nodal versus the Topological Data Layers](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/dualDataLayersHypothesis.md)
Information is stored in two layers: the nodal layer and the topological layer. Each layer has relative advantages and disadvantages over the other in terms of efficiency of data search, data processing, and information retrieval, the appreciation of which is crucial for development of the tribal narrative.

## 13. [Normalization](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/normalizationHypothesis.md)
The tapestry is normalized.

## 14. [Optimization](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/optimizationHypothesis.md)
The topology of the tapestry is optimized for search efficiency and other parameters. This probably occurs on a periodic basis and may be the primary function of sleep.

## 15. [Theory of Mind](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/theoryOfMindHypothesis.md)
Theory of mind: each tapestry must contain an internal representation (in the form of a concept) of other entities (other people).

## 16. [Ambiguity](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/ambiguityHypothesis.md)
A high tolerance for ambiguity of meaning is one of the hallmarks of the tapestry method.

## 17. [Superposition of language and knowledge](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/superpositionOfLanguage.md)
The layering of language and of knowledge is another of the hallmarks of the tapestry method.

## 18. [Web of Trust](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/webOfTrustHypothesis.md)
Decentralized consensus is achieved using Web of Trust.
