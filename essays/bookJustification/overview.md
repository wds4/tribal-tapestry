# The Cortical Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis

# Hypotheses

The CTTH is a series of hypotheses, listed below, each of which builds upon the ones before it. The first one is the launching pad.

#### 1. The representation of knowledge in the brain is profoundly influenced by the mandate to facilitate *social linguistic consensus* (SLC). [Details]().

#### 2. Knowledge in the cortex is organized as a graph.

- To achieve SLC, the principles by which structure is imposed over the graph must be as simple and universal as possible.
- Nodes of the graph are organized into sets and concepts using class threads.
