<h1 align="center" >A Test of the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis (TTH)</h1>

We make two Predictions (P):
1. An unexpectedly high percentage of prospective study participants will be unable and / or unwilling to learn and recite the TTH, even once.
2. Of those who are able to recite the TTH at baseline, an unexpectedly high percentage will be unable to recite the TTH a short time later. *The TTH will be automatically and actively erased from memory.*

PROVE ME WRONG -- and get paid to do it!!!!

If you want to prove me wrong, all you have to do is read the TTH, learn it, and be able to pass a simple test of its contents. You even get to see the test ahead of time. Simple as that!!!

<hr />

The First Rule of the Social / Tribal mode is that *we don't talk about the social cognitive mode.* a.k.a: *Thou shalt not EVER recite the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis (TTH) in its entirety.*

To test our Predictions (P), two people, a Questioner and a Subject, familarize themselves with the TTH as stated on the accompanying pages, either indepdently or together, until they are each satisfied that they are familiar with the TTH. Specifically, the Subject and the Questioner should each independently be satisfied:
1. that the TTH is substantive, i.e. both testable and nontrivial
2. that the TTH novel, i.e. it contains at least one substantive element that they have not encountered elsewhere.

To demonstrate such satisfaction, they should each write down at least one such element. If they are not so satisfied, do not proceed with the test.

At t = baseline, the test is performed using the accompanying Worksheet. A certain amount of time later (between one day and one week later; ideally involving at least one sleep cycle) the test is repeated; this is the "follow up" test. The primary endpoint will be the percentage change in score between the baseline and the follow up test. One or more control hypotheses of similar complexity may be devised for comparison.

Participants will be paid for participation, with a bonus payment for higher test scores.
