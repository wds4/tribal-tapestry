Tribal Tapestry
=====

# List of Hypotheses

## 1. [Oh Shit, We Have Enemies!](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/humanConditionHypothesis.md)
The human condition -- the fact that we have enemies -- drives a new twist in how the brain operates.

## 2. [The Other]()
The formation of tribes requires rejection of The Other.

## 3. [The Tribal Narrative Fiction.]()
Tribes are defined by tribal narratives, and distinguished by the Narrative Fiction.

## 4. [Tribal Superposition]()
Tribal narratives, and therefore tribes themselves, layer on top of one another in the same way that languages do.

## 5. [Proof of Loyalty]()
Toxicity serves a purpose: proof of loyalty to the tribe.

## 6. [Virtue Signals]()
Virtue Signals demonstrate proof of loyalty and weave toxic threads into the narrative fiction.

## 7. [There's Truth, and Then There's "Truth"](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/dualModeHypothesis.md)
Basic human cognition employs two distinct modes to arrive at what it considers "truth:" the objective mode and the tribal mode.

## 8. [Da Vince versus Derrida](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/postmodernismHypothesis.md)
The Enlightenment and postmodernism represent the triumph of the objective mode and the tribal mode, respectively. But each approach suffers due to a failure to appreciate the purpose of the opposing cognitive mode.

## 9. [That Which Shall Not Be Named](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/primeDirectiveHypothesis.md)
Tribal Tapestry Theory is universally toxic; the Prime Directive commands us to reject the very vocabulary required to discuss it.

## 10. [Look at me: I am the Web of Trust Now]()
Tribalism distorts the web of trust and replaces decentralized influence with centralized power.

## 11. [The Mystery of Majesty]()
There is a spiritual need for mystery, paradox, and saviour that was left unfulfilled by the Enlightenment.

## 12. [A New Way]()
Can we create an Enlightenment Part 2, but in a way that satisfies our spiritual needs?
