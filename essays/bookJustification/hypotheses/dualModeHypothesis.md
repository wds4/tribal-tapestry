Dual Mode Hypothesis
=====

Basic human * cognition employs two distinct modes to arrive at what it considers "truth:" the objective mode and the tribal mode.
-----

* This probably applies to all social organisms.

There are two modalities that our brains process information to arrive at what our brains consider to be "the truth."

The objective mode is what we would call the scientific method.

The brain defaults to the objective mode except in very special circumstances when the tribal mode kicks in. Basically when the tribal narrative fiction demands it.

The tribal mode employs logical fallacy strategically to defend the tribal narrative fiction.
