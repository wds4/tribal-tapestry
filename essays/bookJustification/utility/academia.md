*Brilliance is hitting a target no one else can hit. Genius is hitting a target no one else can see.* 

Thomas Kuhn tells us that academia has blind spots. But there's a lot he didn't tell you.

The key observation is that *equivocation* is at the heart of every tribe's cognitive blind spot. Look for those words or concepts whose meanings are subject to equivocation. Specifically, the dishonest kind. Look for lines of reasoning that depend upon the strategic use of equivocation. Challenge members of the field. If they respond with excessive hostility, you are probably over the target.

That's only half the battle, of course. Your elucidation of the field's cognitive blind spot means that there may be hidden gems in plain sight, just waiting for a clear thinker to pick them up. But you still have to do the work to find them. Often that will require an entire vocabulary that does not exist. Your thought patterns have probably taught you to avoid the very places you want to go. You're going to have to invent the terminology yourself.

Below are some academic fields with a few terms whose meanings I propose are deliberately ambiguous, used strategically for the purpose of deception. Come up with an argument which you believe is misleading and which depends upon the sleight-of-hand in which the definition of the term is changed inside the argument.

## Economics 

The easiest example for our purposes is *money* in economics.

Definition 2:

Deceptive argument:

## Neuroscience

Consciousness. Free will.

## Phyicis

Probability
