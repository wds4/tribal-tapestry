The core hypothesis of this book is called the Dual Cognitive Modes hypothesis and is summarized as follows.

## The Core DCM hypothesis, in one sentence

**The brain of the social animal, including (but not limited to) humans, has two cognitive modes of operation: the *default cognitive mode* and the *social cognitive mode***. 

## Explanation of the core DCM hypothesis

tl/dr: the social mode is defined by its opposition to the default mode; the default mode does whatever the individual deems is worth doing

The two cognitive modes differ in three fundamental ways: why they exist, when they operate, and what they do (or equivalently, how they work).

## Why
- The purpose of the default cognitive mode is to *benefit* the individual [1], where "benefit" is judged by the individual, with no justification or explanation needed.
- The purpose of the social cognitive mode is to gain acceptance by the tribe; to *belong*.

## When
- The default cognitive mode is ALWAYS in control, in EVERY context, by default, UNLESS it is overridden by the social cognitive mode.
- The social cognitive mode overrides the default cognitive mode ONLY when required to do so by the tribal narrative fiction. Since every tribe has its own unique and distinctive narrative fiction, when this mode kicks in is only in very particular, highly specific contexts, SPECIFIC TO THE TRIBE.

## What / How
- default mode: n/a (The core DCM hypothesis does not require us to specify!)
- social mode: demonstrations of loyalty to the tribe by the performance of virtue signals (see below)

## Virtue signals

The purpose of a virtue signal is to broadcast / demonstrate / shout from the mountaintops (to tribal insiders AND outsiders) that the tribal narrative fiction has been woven irreversibly into one's brain.

## Tribal narrative fiction

A collection of toxic threads (see below), woven together, into a pattern that is unique to the tribe. The narrative fiction is a subset of the tribal narrative, which is typically vast and contains many threads which are not necessarily toxic.

## Toxic threads

A toxic thread is defined as one that causes harm to the individual. "Toxic" = damaging to the individual. This can play out in multiple ways, most (or maybe all) of which are a consequence of interference with the normal functioning of the default cognitive mode.

Given these definitions, the strict form of the DCM hypothesis does not require us to specify how or why the default mode works, other than that it benefits the individual in some manner. *The social mode is effectively defined by its opposition to the default mode.*

## Why this system makes sense

Incorporation of a toxic thread into one's psyche is an act of self sacrifice that is hard to fake, hard to undo, and diminishes the feasibility of defecting to enemy tribes. This makes it an effective indicator of tribal loyalty.

The uniqueness of the tribal narrative is essential: it's how we distinguish one tribe from another. Like a uniform or a flag. This is why the imagery of weaving threads into a tapestry is useful. Tapestry theory indicates that the weaving of threads is not some flowery but empty metaphor: it is literal.

# Auxiliary hypothesis

We add an *auxiliary* hypothesis to the core DCM hypothesis, which is that the purpose of the default cognitive mode is this: to confer survival benefit to the individual by maintaining a representation of the world that is both relevant and *objectively true*. It does this through reliance on observation, logical consistency, rules of logic, etc; what some humans would call "the scientific method." Note that it doesn't have to be the real, actual objective truth. The only thing that matters is that the individual believes in it.

A corollary to the auxiliary DCM hypothesis is that the toxic threads that make up the tribal narrative fiction would consist primarily of logical fallacies, nonfalsifiable statements, and observably false statements, woven into a pattern that is unique to the tribe. The social cognitive mode, which is defined to be in opposition to the default cognitive mode, would be expected to weave this pattern into the individual's brain and to advertise this fact through virtue signals.

## Objective truth

Objective truth refers to the truth according to whatever reality is accessible to us, whether that be a simulation, a butterfly's dream, or something else. Objective truth does NOT refer to the deeper, underlying truth that is not accessible to us ... assuming one exists (which is unknowable, by definition).

## Don't Know Thyself

Another auxiliary hypothesis of this book is the Prime Directive, which is the directive to deny and be unaware of the full extent of the social cognitive mode in oneself and in one's tribe, despite an exquisite sensitivity to its presence in The Other. In other words, to be ignorant of the DCM hypothesis (core + auxiliary). The primary method is to erase the very words that are used to communicate the hypothesis, as exemplified by the idea that reference to objective reality is patronizing or in some way a bad thing. Adherence to the Prime Directive is neuro-normative behaviour, while deviation from the Prime Directive is one way of being neuroatypical.

The Prime Directive makes sense: Any strategy that can minimize the damage of the narrative fiction to the default cognitive mode will be implemented. The social mode requires us to contradict objective reality, which means we have to lie, and there is literature that self-deception can decrease the cognitve cost of lying. IOW, the best liar is one who believes the lie.

## additional remarks

*Make note of the fact that the core DCM hypothesis introduces the concepts of narrative fiction and toxicity but does so in a manner that requires NO reference or mention whatsoever of objective reality, the scientific method, falsifiability, logic, hypocrisy, etc. These don't come in until we add the auxiliary hypothesis. But even without the auxiliary hypothesis, there is substance to be found within the core DCM hypothesis.*

[1] I'm not sure whether to add this caveat to the purpose of the default cognitive mode: to benefit the individual in any manner, *except not including the benefits that are already addressed by the social cognitive mode*.
