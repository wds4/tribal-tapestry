Prologue: A Butterfly's Dream
=====

You are going to see a lot of talk about *toxicity* and *objective reality* in this book. In these pages, you will witness the Champion of the Enlightenment, Da Vinci and the Champion of Postmodernism, Derrida, clash like knights of a medieval kingdom. Perhaps you follow Ayn Rand, and like a good objectivist, you believe in objective reality. Real is real. A equals A.

But ... perhaps that view is not satisfying to you. What if I'm not sure that I believe in objective reality? What if you take a slighlty different view that reality, the laws of physics are what the Bible means by the Word of God? What if agree with Elon Musk, that there is a good chance we are living in a simulation? What if I wonder whether we might be living in the dream of a butterfly? 

We do not answer those questions. And we do not require you to commit to any one of those views over the others. 

This book is a theory about how the brain of the social animal works. We hypothesize that the brain has two modes of arriving at what the brain considers to be a working definition of "the truth:" the objective cognitive mode and the tribal cognitive mode. These modes are defined, NOT in terms of whether the results of their deliberations are True or False, but in terms of the methodologies. The objective cognitive mode comprises one set of methods that the brain employs by default, all the time, and which correspond loosely to the scientific method. The scientific cognitive mode is designed to employ logic; to reject statements of fact that are contradicted by observation; to detect and to reject logic that relies upon logical fallacy.

The objective mode is used all the time, EXCEPT when the tribal cognitive mode overrides it. From time to time, the rules of society require us to demonstrate our allegiance to the tribe by endorsing the tribal narrative fiction. By definition, the narrative fiction is a tapestry built out of toxic threads. And by definition, a toxic thread is one that would be rejected by the objective cognitive mode.

Let's say that again. Is a toxic thread defined as one that is objectively incorrect? No. It's not. It's defined as a thread that would be rejected by the thought patterns of the scientific cognitive method. That's it.

In this book, we make no assumption that the objective mode arrives at Reality. If we're living in a simulation, then this book presents a theory of how the brain works in the simulation.

According to this theory of brain and behaviour, the brain craves mystery. Paradox. Self-decepion. Logical fallacies. Things that we refer to in this book as *toxicity*. No, not (necessarily) because of some forgotten childhood trauma. But evolution has it our default position, traumatized or not, to be that way. Because the human condition is that we have enemies. Which means we need allies. We need tribes. And toxicity is the glue that holds tribes together. No, not just *that* tribe. Yours too. All tribes.

And in the end, we will be forced to admit upfront that toxicity does not mean objectively incorrect. YOUR narrative fiction might, in fact, be objectively correct! Our goal by the end of this book will be to put Da Vinci at your right hand, and Derrida at your left.
