Knowledge in the cortex is organized as a graph.

Could merge 1-3: Mathematics is the schelling point to begin the decentralized representation of knowledge (decentralized language). Or: Decentralied linguistic consensus cannot begin without a schelling point. Math provides that schelling point.

Decentralized language requires two things: some sort of schelling point from which to start, and a WoT.

Progression beyond the starting point requires arbitrary decisions which cannot be made without a functioning web of trust. Language requires consensus on the arbitrary symbols that a community uses to represent knowledge. But before consensus can be established, there must be two things: a starting point, springboard, schelling point from which to start; and a WoT. The Tapestry Foundation describes how that comes into place.

Language, whether biological or digital, is the symbolic representation of thoughts, ideas, and information. Where do these symbols come from? There is a certain arbitrariness to them. Who decides the English word for pencil? Who decides the data types for javascript? Who decides whether the property name for the timestamp of a nostr event is created_at rather than createdAt? For most symbols, there is no particular controversy. Most of us are perfectly content to use whatever symbols everyone else uses (within reason of course -- no one would accept a 20 syllable word for pencil). For most symbols, most of us just want to be on the same page as everyone else, and that's all that matters.

We will use the phrase decentralized linguistic consensus to refer to consensus on those symbols that does not require centralized authorities or stweards. The basic starting point of the tapestry theory is that DLC requires two prerequisites: a universal language and a method for WoT. The universal language must have nothing arbitrary about it. We argue that the only universal language to satisfy those conditions is mathematics. In particular: set theory and graph theory. We will develop this idea in the following sections.
