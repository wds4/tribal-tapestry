Tapestry Theory
=====

The Tribal Tapestry theory is a series of hypotheses, listed below, each of which builds upon the ones before it.

# The Foundation

- "Let's all be friends."
- inclusive
- decentralized

## [SLC Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/socialLinguisticConsensusHypothesis.md)
The need for *social linguistic consensus* (SLC) shapes how knowledge is represented and curated in the brain.

## ? [Universality Hypothesis]()
The SLC exerts evolutionary pressure for the fundamentals of language to be as universal as possible. Every commitment restricts the universe of entities with which to communicate.

## [Graph Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/graphHypothesis.md)
Knowledge in the cortex is organized as a graph.

## ? [Node Flexibility Hypothesis]()
The SLC exerts pressure to provide the nodes of the tapestry with as much flexibility as possibility in terms of physical structure and data format.

## ? [Neuronal Hypothesis]()
Nodes in the cortex are patches of neurons

## [Principles of Organization Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/principlesOfOrganization.md)
The SLC exerts pressure to make the *principles of organization* of the graph as simple and universal as possible.

## [Class Threads Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/classThreadsHypothesis.md)
Nodes of the graph are organized into sets and concepts using class threads.

## [Constraints Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/constraints.md)
Concepts are formatted according to constraint nodes.

## ? [Integration Hypothesis]()
There is evolutionary pressure for the tapestry to be integrated as tightly and extensively as possible.

## [Vertical Integraion Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/verticalIntegrationHypothesis.md)
Concepts are integrated vertically using the class propagation edge and the class termination edge (2 of the 3 edges that go into the definition of class threads).

## [Object Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/objectHypothesis.md)
Constraint nodes are decomposed into properties in a manner designed to facilitate and maximize horizontal integration of the graph.

## [Normalization Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/normalizationHypothesis.md)
The tapestry is normalized.

## [Optimization Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/optimizationHypothesis.md)
The topology of the tapestry is optimized to increase search efficiency.

## [Theory of Mind Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/theoryOfMindHypothesis.md)
Theory of mind: each tapestry must contain an internal representation (in the form of a concept) of other entities (other people).

## [Web of Trust Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/webOfTrustHypothesis.md)
Decentralized consensus is achieved using Web of Trust.

# Tribal Tapestry 

- "Oh shit, we have enemies."
- exclusive: community identity based largely upon rejection of The Other
- centralized

## [The Human Condition Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/humanConditionHypothesis.md)
The human condition -- the fact that we can never all get along -- shapes how the brain curates information (shapes the WoT).

## [Dual Mode Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/dualModeHypothesis.md)
Basic human cognition employs two distinct modes to arrive at what it considers "truth:" the objective mode and the tribal mode.

## [The Function of Toxicity Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/functionOfToxicityHypothesis.md)
Toxicity serves a purpose: proof of loyalty to the tribe.

## [The Postmodernism Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/postmodernismHypothesis.md)
The Enlightenment and postmodernism represent the rejection of the tribal mode and the objective mode, respectively.

## [Prime Directive Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/primeDirectiveHypothesis.md)
Tribal Tapestry Theory is universally toxic.
