<h1 align="center" >A Test of the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis (TTH)</h1>

We make two predictions:
1. An unexpectedly high percentage of prospective study participants will be unable or unwilling to learn and recite the TTH, even once.
2. Of those who are able to recite the TTH at baseline, an unexpectedly high percentage will be unable to recite the TTH a short time later. *The TTH will be automatically and actively erased from memory.*

PROVE ME WRONG!!!!

If you want to prove me wrong, all you have to do is read the TTH, learn it, and be able to pass a simple test a short time later. You even get to see the test ahead of time. Simple as that!!!

The First Rule of the Social / Tribal mode is that *we don't talk about the social cognitive mode.* a.k.a: *Thou shalt not EVER recite the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis (TTH) in its entirety.*

We therefore make the following Prediction (P): a neuro normative person (the Subject), having learned the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis (TTH) well enough to state it at a baseline point in time, will have difficulty *remembering* the TTH, because the healthy brain will *actively erase* the TTH.

To test our Prediction (P), two people, a Questioner and a Subject, familarize themselves with the TTH as stated on the accompanying pages, either indepdently or together, until they are each satisfied that they are familiar with the TTH. Specifically, the Subject and the Questioner should each independently be satisfied:
1. that the TTH is substantive, i.e. both testable and nontrivial
2. that the TTH novel, i.e. it contains at least one substantive element that they have not encountered elsewhere.

To demonstrate such satisfaction, they should each write down at least one such element. If they are not so satisfied, do not proceed with the test.

Note that the TTH predicts that many people will actively resist participation in this test because the simple act of becoming familiar with the TTH is a violation of the First Rule. To mitigate such resistance, it may help to provide reassurance that recitation of the TTH does not equate to an endorsement of its veracity.

A certain amount of time later (between one day and one week later; ideally involving at least one sleep cycle) the test is performed using the accompanying Worksheet.

Our Prediction (P) is that the Subject's ability to state the TTH will deteriorate rapidly. Specifically, the Subject will be *unable to recall* any elements that the Subject previously considered both substantive and novel.
