The Function of Toxicity Hypothesis
=====

Toxicity serves a purpose: tribal acceptance.
-----

The tribal narrative of most (all?) tribes contains toxic threads that serve a purpose: to set the narrative apart from all others.

The mandate as set forth by [social linguistic consensus](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/glossary/socialLinguisticConsensus.md) aims to be as maximally inclusive as possible.

The mandate of tribal consensus (TC) represents a reversal of SLC: it is based upon exclusion rather than inclusion. It is predicated on the notion that acceptance by the tribe demands a renunciation of The Other.

SLC aims to communicate with as many entities as possible. Tribalism aims to do the opposite: to break down into tribes. SLC facilitates influence; tribalism is the triumph of power over influence.

(On a side note: the purpose of my apps is to build influence via an implementation of SLC. It is in opposition to TC.)
