Prologue: A Butterfly's Dream
=====

You are going to see a lot of talk about *toxicity* and *objective reality* in this book. In these pages, you will witness the Champion of the Enlightenment, Da Vinci and the Champion of Postmodernism, Derrida, clash like knights of a medieval kingdom. Perhaps you follow Ayn Rand, and like a good objectivist, you believe in objective reality. Real is real. A equals A.

But ... perhaps that view is not satisfying to you. What if I'm not sure that I believe in objective reality? What if you take a slighlty different view that reality, the laws of physics are what the Bible means by the Word of God? What if agree with Elon Musk, that there is a good chance we are living in a simulation? What if I wonder whether we might be living in the dream of a butterfly? 

We do not answer those questions. And we do not require you to commit to any one of those views over the others. 

This book is a theory about how the brain of the social animal works. We hypothesize that the brain has two modes of arriving at what the brain considers to be a working definition of "the truth:" the default cognitive mode and the tribal cognitive mode. These modes are defined, NOT in terms of whether the results of their deliberations are ACTUALLY True or False, but in terms of their methodologies. The default cognitive mode comprises one set of methods that the brain employs all the time and in all contexts, by default, unless it gets overridden by the tribal mode. The default cognitive mode relies upon observation and employs logic. It rejects statements of fact that are contradicted by observation. It rejects unfalsifiable assertions on the grounds that they are unfalsifiable. It rejects reasoning that it considers to be based on logical fallacy.

The default mode is used all the time, in all contexts, EXCEPT when the tribal cognitive mode overrides it. This happens only in very specific, very particular contexts that depend very much upon the tribe in question. From time to time, the rules of society require us to demonstrate our allegiance to the tribe by endorsing the tribal narrative fiction. By definition, the narrative fiction is a tapestry built out of toxic threads. And by definition, a toxic thread is one that would be rejected by anyone external to the tribe. In other words, a toxic thread is one that would be rejected by the standard practices of the default cognitive mode. Incorporation of a toxic thread into one's psyche is an act of self sacrifice that is hard to fake and hard to undo, which is why it can serve as an indicator of tribal loyalty.

In this book, we make no assumption that the default mode arrives at Reality. It simply is what it is. If we're living in a simulation, then the default cognitive mode probably does a bang up job of discovering the rules of the simulation.

According to this theory of brain and behaviour, the brain craves mystery. Paradox. Self-decepion. Logical fallacies. Things that we refer to in this book as *toxicity*. No, not (necessarily) because of some forgotten childhood trauma. But evolution has it our default position, traumatized or not, to be that way. Because the human condition is that we have enemies. Which means we need allies. We need tribes. And toxicity is the glue that holds tribes together. No, not just *that* tribe. Yours too. All tribes.

And in the end, we will be forced to admit upfront that toxicity does not mean objectively incorrect. YOUR narrative fiction might, in fact, be objectively correct! Our goal by the end of this book will be to put Da Vinci at your right hand, and Derrida at your left.
