<h1 align="center" >A Test of the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis</h1>

The First Rule of the Social / Tribal mode is that *we don't talk about the social cognitive mode.* a.k.a: *Thou shalt not EVER recite the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis in its entirety.*

We therefore make the following prediction: a neuro normative person, defined for our purposes as someone who follows the First Rule, will have inordinate amount of difficulty learning and, more interestingly, *remembering* the Hypothesis. This is expected to manifest in several ways, including a refusal to make the attempt. The most interesting prediction is that a subject who knows the Hypothesis at one period in time will find that the content of the Hypothesis has been forgotten, like a dream, as if actively erased from the mind, and that this erasure will happen in a surprisingly short amount of time.

To test this hypothesis, two people, a Questioner and a Subject, familarize themselves with the Hypothesis, either indepdently or together, until they are each satisfied that they are familiar with the Hypothesis.

A certain amount of time later (between one day and one week later) the test is performed using the Worksheet.

# Comments

A more thorough testing protocol would include a control theory of comparable complexity. The prediction would be that the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis will be actively erased over some time period during which the control theory is not erased.
