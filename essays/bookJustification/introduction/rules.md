The Rules of the Social Mode
=====

## First Rule

We don't talk about the social mode.

Alternative statement: Thou shalt never recite (or tolerate the recitation of) the Dual Cognitive Mode Hypothesis in its entirety.

## Second Rule

Problematization of the notion of objective reality (in the abstract) is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

## Third Rule

Misrepresentation of the state of mind of The Other and or of The Self is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

## Fourth Rule

Logical fallacy is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

Alternative statement: Equivocation is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

## Fifth Rule

The *Problematization* of an (otherwise unproblematic, per the standard mode) idea or concept is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

A common pattern is to equivocate between the following two stances:
- Of course X is true, and with very good justification. How can you be so blind to the justification?
- Of course X is false. How can you make such an unjustified accusation?
This is accomplished by alteration of the definition of X, i.e. equivocation.

## ? Rule

The implicit or explicit advocacy of obediance to each of the above Rules (in the abstract) is a virtue, when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

# The Tribe of the Order of the Tapestry 

The core tribal narrative fiction is the following:

Thou shalt disobey each and every Rule of the Social Mode.

This meets the criteria of being toxic -- which means it might work!

Why? So we can prevent unnecessary, destructive, idiotic tribal warfare. (according to the value system of this tribe.)

## Problematise

To render a word or statement problematic means to endeavor to change the definitions of one or more words until one of the following states is reached. Typically this is achieved using one of the following methods:

1. It is devoid of any content.
   subset: it is devoid of any *new* content.
2. It is morally offensive.
3. It is incorrect.

Equivocation between two or more of the above methods accompanied by studious ignorance of the statement itself is a strong indicator of the social cognitive mode.
