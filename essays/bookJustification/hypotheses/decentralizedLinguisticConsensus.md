Decentralized Linguistic Consensus
=====

The need for *decentralized linguistic consensus* (DLC) determines the basic structure of knowledge representation.
-----

Language, whether biological or digital, is the symbolic representation of thoughts, ideas, and information. But where do these symbols come from? What is the Greek word for pencil? What are the list of data types for javascript? What is the symbol for the digit between 3 and 5? What is the name of the field for the timestamp of a nostr event: created_at, createdAt, or something else? To these questions and many like them, there are a large number of perfectly reasonable answers. The choices that we make, to a great extent, are quite *arbitrary*. 

We will use the phrase *decentralized linguistic consensus* to refer to consensus over our choices of symbolic representation that is achieved in the absence of centralized authorities or stewards. The challenge of the decentralized web is to build digital applications and platforms that allow users to achieve DLC over our digital tools of interaction, thus obviating the need for centralized stewardship of those tools.

The basic starting point of tapestry theory is that DLC requires two prerequisites: a universal language and a method for WoT.

We will develop these ideas in the following sections.
