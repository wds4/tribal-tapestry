The Rules of the Social Mode
=====

## First Rule

We don't talk about the social mode.

Alternative statement: Thou shalt never recite (or tolerate the recitation of) the Dual Cognitive Mode Hypothesis in its entirety.

## Second Rule

Problematization of the notion of objective reality (in the abstract) is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

## Third Rule

Misrepresentation of the state of mind of The Other is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

Misrepresentation of the state of mind of The Self is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

## Fourth Rule

Equivocation is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative.

## Fifth Rule

Logical fallacy is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative.

# The Tribe of the Order of the Tapestry 

The core tribal narrative fiction is the following:

Thou shalt disobey each and every Rule of the Social Mode.

This meets the criteria of being toxic -- which means it might work!

Why? So we can prevent unnecessary, destructive, idiotic tribal warfare. (according to the value system of this tribe.)
