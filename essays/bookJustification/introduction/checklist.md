<h1 align="center" >A Test of the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis</h1>

The First Rule of the Social / Tribal mode is that *we don't talk about the social cognitive mode.* a.k.a: *Thou shalt not EVER recite the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis in its entirety.*

We therefore make the following prediction: a neuro normative person, defined for our purposes as someone who follows the First Rule, will have inordinate amount of difficulty learning and reciting the Hypothesis. This is expected to manifest in several ways, including a refusal to make the attempt. The most interesting prediction is that a subject who knows the Hypothesis at one period in time will find that the content of the Hypothesis has been forgotten, like a dream, as if actively erased from the mind, and that this erasure will happen in a surprisingly short amount of time.

To test this hypothesis, two people, a Questioner and a Subject, familarize themselves with the Hypothesis, either indepdently or together, until they are each satisfied that they are familiar with the Hypothesis.

A certain amount of time later (between one day and one week later) the test is performed using the following Worksheet.

<h1 align="center" >Worksheet</h1>

The Questioner takes this sheet of paper ("A Test of the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis") and tests the Subject as follows:

Question: *State the hypothesis of the Tribal Tapestry, in its entirety, in your own words.*

The Subject must answer this question from memory. The Questioner checks which of the following are included in the answer.

## Checklist
- [ ] There are two cognitive modes, ______ and ______
- [ ] These two modes differ in 3 ways: why, when, and what (or how)
  - [ ] why: ______
  - [ ] when: ______
  - [ ] what (how): ______

- [ ] Definition of a Tribal Narrative: _____
- [ ] Definition of the Narrative Fiction: _____
- [ ] Definition of Toxicity: _____

- [ ] The social / tribal mode imposes a list of rules:
- [ ] First: ______
- [ ] Second: ______
- [ ] Third: ______
- [ ] Fourth: ______
- [ ] Fifth: ______

## the neuro normative response
According to the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis, a neuro normative person will be either unwilling or unable to pass the test. We predict frequent outcomes to be one of the following:

1. *Refusal to take the test because of reasons.*

2. An abbreviated response:
- [ ] people are tribal, and that's bad, and we should do better

In case of 2, the Questioner may prompt the following questions:
1. What are the two cognitive modes?
2. How do they differ?
3. How do you define: Tribal Narrative, Narrative Fiction, Toxicity?
4. What is the First Rule?
5. What are the rest of the Rules?

# Comments

A more thorough testing protocol would include a control theory of comparable complexity. The prediction would be that the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis will be actively erased over some time period during which the control theory is not erased.
