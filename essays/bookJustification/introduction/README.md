The core hypothesis of this book will be called the Dual Cognitive Modes hypothesis and will be summarized as follows.

## The Core DCM hypothesis, in one sentence

**The brain of the social animal, including (but not limited to) humans, has two cognitive modes of operation: the *default cognitive mode* and the *social cognitive mode***. 

## Elaboration of the DCM hypothesis

The two cognitive modes differ in three fundamental ways: why they exist, when they operate, and what they do (or equivalently, how they work).

## Why
- The purpose of the social mode is to gain acceptance by the tribe; to *belong*.
- The purpose of the default cognitive mode is to *benefit* the individual in any manner other than that already covered by the social mode. Benefit means: as judged by the individual. [1]

## When
- The default mode is active always, by default, UNLESS it is overridden by the social mode.
- The social mode overrides the default mode ONLY when required to do so by the tribal narrative fiction. Since every tribe has its own unique and distinctive narrative fiction, when this mode kicks in is HIGHLY CONTEXTUAL.

## What
- default mode: n/a [1]
- social mode: demonstrations of loyalty to the tribe by performance of virtue signals

## Virtue signals

The purpose of a virtue signal is to BROADCAST (to tribal insiders AND outsiders) the internalization of the tribal narrative fiction.

## Tribal narrative fiction

A collection of toxic threads, woven together, into a pattern that is unique to the tribe

## Toxic threads

A toxic thread is defined as one that impairs the normal functioning of the default cognitive mode. "Toxic" = toxic to the default cognitive mode. 

Given these definitions, the strict form of the DCM hypothesis does not require us to specify how or why the default mode works, other than that it benefits the individual in some manner. *The social mode is effectively defined by its opposition to the default mode.*

## Why this system makes sense

Incorporation of a toxic thread into one's psyche is an act of self sacrifice that is hard to fake, hard to undo, and diminishes the feasibility of defecting to enemy tribes. This makes it an effective indicator of tribal loyalty; not a perfect indicator, but arguably the best indicator that there is.

## Auxiliary hypothesis

[1] We add an *auxiliary* hypothesis that this is how and why the default cognitive mode works: its purpose is to confer survival benefit to the individual by maintaining a representation of the world that is both relevant and *objectively true*. It does this through reliance on observation, consistency, rules of logic; what some humans would call "the scientific method."

## Objective truth

Objective truth refers to the truth according to whatever reality is accessible to us, whether that be a simulation, a butterfly's dream, or something else. Objective truth does NOT refer to the deeper, underlying truth that is not accessible to us ... assuming one exists (which is unknowable, by definition).

## Don't Know Thyself

An auxiliary hypothesis of this book is the Prime Directive, which is the directive to deny the full extent of the social cognitive mode in oneself and in one's tribe, despite an exquisite sensitivity to its presence in The Other. In other words, be ignorant of the DCM hypothesis. The primary method is to erase the very words that are used to communicate the hypothesis. Adherence to the Prime Directive is neuro-normative behaviour, while deviation from the Primae Directive is one way of being neuroatypical.

The Prime Directive makes sense: Any strategy that can minimize the damage of the narrative fiction to the default cognitive mode will be implemented. The social mode requires us to lie, and there is literature that self-deception decreases the cognitve cost of lying. IOW, the best liar is one who believes the lies.

## additional remarks

*Make note of the fact that the core DCM hypothesis introduces the concepts of narrative fiction and toxicity but does so in a manner that requires NO reference or mention whatsoever of objective reality, the scientific method, falsifiability, logic, hypocrisy, etc. These don't come in until we add the auxiliary hypothesis (below). But even without the auxiliary hypothesis, there is substance to be found here.*
