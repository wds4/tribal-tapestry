Prologue: A Butterfly's Dream
=====

You are going to see a lot of talk about *toxicity* and *objective reality* in this book. In these pages, you will witness the Champion of the Enlightenment, Da Vinci and the Champion of Postmodernism, Derrida, clash like knights of a medieval kingdom. You will wonder: what if I'm not sure that I believe in objective reality? What if agree with Elon Musk, that there is a good chance we are living in a simulation? What if I wonder whether we might be living in the dream of a butterfly? 

What if you follow Ayn Rand, and like a good objectivist, you DO believe in objective reality? Of if you take a slighlty different view that the laws of physics are what the Bible means by the Word of God?

We do not answer those questions. And we do not require you to commit to any one of those views over the others. This book is a theory about how the brain works. If we're living in a simulation, then this book is a book about how the brain works, in the simulation. Same goes for the dream of a butterfly.

And in the end, we will be forced to admit upfront that toxicity does not mean objectively incorrect. YOUR narrative fiction might, in fact, be objectively correct! Our goal by the end of this book will be to put Da Vinci at your right hand, and Derrida at your left. Or something like that.
