<h1 align="center">The Tribal Tapestry</h1>

**The brain of the social animal, including (but not limited to) humans, has two cognitive modes of operation: the *standard cognitive mode* and the *social cognitive mode***. 

## Test of the DCMH (including corollary, below)

Read the DCMH, restate it in your own words, and then write it from memory on a separate sheet of paper. If you are neuro-normative, YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO DO SO.

## Explanation

The two cognitive modes differ in three fundamental ways: why, when, what

## Why
- The purpose of the standard cognitive mode is to maintain a model of the world that is relevant, accurate, and most importantly, *useful*.
- The purpose of the social cognitive mode is to gain acceptance by the tribe; to *belong*.

## When
- The standard cognitive mode is ALWAYS in control, in EVERY context, by default, UNLESS it is overridden by the social cognitive mode.
- The social cognitive mode overrides the standard cognitive mode ONLY when required to do so by the tribal narrative fiction. Since every tribe has its own unique and distinctive narrative fiction, when this mode kicks in is only in very particular, highly specific contexts, SPECIFIC TO THE TRIBE.

## What / How
- standard cognitive mode: observation and logic
- social cognitive mode: demonstrations of loyalty to the tribe by the performance of virtue signals

## Virtue signals

The purpose of a virtue signal is to broadcast / demonstrate / shout from the mountaintops (to tribal insiders AND outsiders) that the tribal narrative fiction has been woven irreversibly into one's brain.

## Tribal narrative fiction

A collection of toxic threads, woven together, into a pattern that is unique to the tribe and that serves to distinguish one tribe from another. The narrative fiction is a subset of the greater tribal narrative, which is typically vast and contains many threads which are not necessarily toxic.

## Toxic threads

Think of a thread as a reference to a thought or an idea.

A toxic thread is defined as one that exacts a cost to the individual via interference with the normal functioning of the standard cognitive mode. Toxicity is typically achieved either by contradicting observation or engaging in logical fallacy. These are always done in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

## The game theory for why this system makes sense

Incorporation of a toxic thread into one's psyche is an act of self sacrifice that is hard to fake, hard to undo, and diminishes the feasibility of defecting to enemy tribes. This makes it an effective indicator of tribal loyalty.

## The First Rule of the Social Mode

Though shalt NEVER recite the Dual Cognitive Mode Hypothesis (the contents of this page) in its entirety, because doing so will impair your ability to virtue signal convincingly.

## Implementation of the First Rule

Any discussion of the DCMH shall be ignored if possible, or derailed if necessary. The words utlilized to state the DCMH shall be reinterpreted so that any attempted recitation of the DCMH becomes either lacking in substance or offensive (or both).

## Corollary to the DCMH:

- Neuro-normative people are compelled to follow the First Rule of the Social Mode.
- If you break the First Rule, your ability to virtue signal convincingly will be impaired.
