# The Cortical Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis

# Abstract 

Before we can proceed with our top-pick Oprah Book List and NYT Best Seller, The Tribal Tapestry, we must first come to an agreement as to 1) what the Cortical Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis actually states and 2) whether it is well formulated, novel, plausibly true, and useful. If it does not meet ALL of those requirements, it means we have nothing new to say and there is no sense writing the book – unless we want to be charlatans, repackaging tired old ideas in a new wrapper, which neither one of us wants to do. Whether or not we present the full hypothesis in all its glorious detail in the book is another matter. Some parts may be too dry and boring. But there’s no way to decide which parts to include without first coming to agreement on the model itself. Below, I present the model as a series of hypotheses, each of which layer upon the ones before it.

# The Claim

I claim that the CTTH is well formulated, novel, plausible, and useful.

# Counterclaim

- not substantive
- not novel
- implausible
- not useful

# Hypotheses

The CTTH is a series of hypotheses, listed below, each of which builds upon the ones before it.

## social linguistic consensus

The organization of the brain is determined primarily by the need to address the problem of [social linguistic consensus](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/glossary/socialLinguisticConsensus.md).

## knowledge in the cortex is organized topologically

Knowledge is broken down into small chunks, called nodes, and organized into a graph.

## Principles of organization

Structure is imposed on the graph by principles of organization. The mandate to achieve social linguistic consensus dictates that these principles must be as simple and universal as possible.

The first two principles of organization are the class thread principle and object principles.

## Class thread principle

Pieces of data are organized into sets using class threads.

## Object principles

Constraints are decomposed in a manner that maximizes horizontal integration of knowledge.

# Utility

At the individual level: to maximize meaning, belonging, and acceptance while minimizing the costs accociated with tribalism. 

- to diagnose pathology internally, from within one's own tribe
- to diagnose pathology in The Other's tribe and inform our decisions regarding how to respond
