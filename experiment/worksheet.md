## the neuro normative response
According to the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis, a neuro normative person will be either unwilling or unable to pass the test. We predict frequent outcomes to be one of the following:

1. *Refusal to take the test because of reasons.*

2. An abbreviated response:
- [ ] people are tribal, and that's bad, and we should do better

In case of 2, the Questioner may prompt the following questions:
1. What are the two cognitive modes?
2. How do they differ?
3. How do you define: Tribal Narrative, Narrative Fiction, Toxicity?
4. What is the First Rule?
5. What are the rest of the Rules?

# Comments

A more thorough testing protocol would include a control theory of comparable complexity. The prediction would be that the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis will be actively erased over some time period during which the control theory is not erased.
