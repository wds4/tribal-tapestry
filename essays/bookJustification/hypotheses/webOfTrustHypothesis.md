Web of Trust Hypothesis
=====

Decentralized consensus is achieved using Web of Trust.

See my [15 minute slide presentation at Nostrville, Nov 2023 in Nashville](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1SYE5ooZiHaswOsXR23STp), where I propose a two-stage roadmap to build web of trust in the digital realm, followed by my [Overview of Curated Lists](https://github.com/wds4/pretty-good/blob/main/appDescriptions/curatedLists/overview.md) where I present my proof of concept for stage 1 in the form of a desktop app. 

If my web of trust can curate a list, then it can curate a graph, which is two lists: a list of nodes and a list of edges. If it can curate a graph, then it can curate the concept graph of dogs breeds and dogs and animals (above) as I learn English from my parents in the biological realm; or the concept of javascript data types as my app communicates with other apps in the digital realm (see below figure).

The purpose of web of trust is to DISINTERMEDIATE THE POWERFUL by giving INFLUENCE to those who best deserve it. You ask the excellent question: who decides? In a world governed by the influential rather than the powerful, the answer is that YOU have the ultimate authority, because YOU are always and evermore at the center of YOUR web of trust.

Web of trust gives INFLUENCE to those who ought to have it (and in a context-specific manner). Anyone who abuses said influence can and probably will lose it in a jiffy. This is what distinguishes INFLUENCE from POWER.
