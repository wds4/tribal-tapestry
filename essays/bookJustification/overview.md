# The Cortical Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis

# Abstract 

Before we can proceed with our celebrated Oprah Book Club selection and NYT Best Seller, *The Tribal Tapestry*, we must first come to an agreement as to 1) what the Cortical Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis actually states and 2) whether it is well formulated, novel, plausibly true, and useful. If it does not meet ALL of those requirements, it means we have nothing new to say and there is no sense writing the book – unless we want to be charlatans, repackaging tired old ideas in a new wrapper, which neither one of us wants to do. Whether or not we present the full hypothesis in all its glorious detail in the book is another matter. Some parts may be too dry and boring. But leaving it out of the book doesn't mean we don't need to discuss it first. Because there’s no way to decide which parts to include without first coming to agreement on the model itself. Below, I present the model as a series of hypotheses, each of which layer upon the ones before it.

# The Claim

I claim that the CTTH is well formulated, novel, plausible, and useful.

# Counterclaim

- not substantive
- not novel
- implausible
- not useful

# Hypotheses

The CTTH is a series of hypotheses, listed below, each of which builds upon the ones before it.

## 1. The representation of knowledge in the brain is profoundly influenced by the problem of *social linguistic consensus* (SLC).

The organization of the brain is determined primarily by the need to address the problem of [social linguistic consensus](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/glossary/socialLinguisticConsensus.md). We need a universal language to get the ball rolling. That universal language is methematics. Specifically: graph theory (see below) and set theory (see below).

## 2. Knowledge in the cortex is organized as a graph.

Knowledge is broken down into small chunks, called nodes, and organized into a graph. This is not exactly controversial or new. It's hard to imagine that this is NOT the case. 

Knowledge is represented in two layers: the *nodal layer* and the *topological layer*. First and foremost, the tapestry method is concerned with the principles of organization of the topological layer. Conversely, the tapestry method places no restrictions on the physical form and data format of individual nodes. In the biological realm, nodes are patches of neurons: cortical columns, cortical minicolumns, nuclei, or other structures. In the digital realm, a node is a digital file: a data file, an image file, anything. 

There are important differences between information storage between these two methods. The topological layer can store information more efficiently and lends itself to discovery of new relationships. However, information retrieval is much more efficient (faster) from the nodal layer. Much of the brain's "down time" is likely spent on 1) mining the graph for new relationships, the results of which can be stored in nodes, and 2) optimizations of graphical topology. 

## 3. principles of organization

Structure is imposed on the graph by principles of organization. The mandate to achieve social linguistic consensus dictates that these principles must be as simple and universal as possible.

The first two principles of organization are the class thread principle and object principles.

## 3.1 Class thread principle

Pieces of data are organized into sets using class threads.

## 3.2 class object principles

Constraints are decomposed in a manner that maximizes horizontal integration of knowledge.

## Information theory, sleep

Interaction of data between the two layers is likely to yield insights into brain function. This is what I mean when I say that this is an idea that no one has run with.

## 4. Tribalism is antisocial linguistic consensus

SLC aims to communicate with as many entities as possible. Tribalism aims to do the opposite: to break down into tribes. It demarcates the conversion of influence into power.

## 4.1 Dual modes: objective mode and tribal mode

There are two modalities that our brains process information to arrive at what our brains consider to be "the truth."

The objective mode is what we would call the scientific method.

The brain defaults to the objective mode except in very special circumstances when the tribal mode kicks in. Basically when the tribal narrative fiction demands it.

The tribal mode employs logical fallacy strategically to defend the tribal narrative fiction.

## 4.2 Enlightenment versus postmodernism

Postmodernism represents the attempt to enshrine toxicity in the search for Truth. The triumph of the tribal mindset over the objective mindset. 

Enlightenment represents the attempt to purge toxicity in the search for Truth. The triumph of the objective mindset over the tribal mindset.

## 4.3 Toxicity serves a purpose

The tribal narrative of most (all?) tribes contains toxic threads that serve a purpose: to set the narrative apart from all others.

## 4.4 The CTTH is universally toxic

I called this the Prime Directive, but you did not like this name and I can never remember what name we replaced it with.

The reason the cortical tapestry hypothesis remains undiscovered by the neuroscience community is that it is universally toxic. The cortical tapestry hypothesis exists firmly within everyone's cognitive blond spot, as evidenced by the difficulty of finding vocabulary even to state the hypothesis that is not immediately rejected as pejorative, insulting, etc. There is no non-pejorative terminology for: toxic, objective versus tribal mindset, narrative fiction. 

# Utility

At the individual level: to maximize meaning, belonging, and acceptance while minimizing the costs accociated with tribalism. 

- to diagnose pathology internally, from within one's own tribe
- to diagnose pathology in The Other's tribe and inform our decisions regarding how to respond
