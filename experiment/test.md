<h1 align="center" >A Test of the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis (TTH)</h1>

We make two Predictions (P):
1. An unexpectedly high percentage of prospective study participants will be unable and / or unwilling to read, to absorb, and to recite the essential content of the TTH, even once.
2. Of those who are able to recite the TTH at baseline, an unexpectedly high percentage will be unable to recite the TTH a short time later. *The TTH will be automatically and actively erased from memory with a robustness to rival the erasure of a dream by late morning or early afternoon.*

PROVE ME WRONG -- and get paid to do it!!!!

If you want to prove me wrong, all you have to do is read the TTH, learn it, and be able to pass a simple test of its contents at baseline and at follow up a short time later (between 1 day and 1 week). You even get to see the test ahead of time. Simple as that!!!

### Rationale for our Predictions (P)

The First Rule of the Social / Tribal mode is that *We don't talk about the social cognitive mode.* a.k.a: *We don't KNOW about the social cognitive mode.* a.k.a. *Thou shalt NEVER recite the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis (TTH).*

### Test Procedure

To test our Predictions (P), two people, a Questioner and a Subject, familarize themselves with the TTH as stated on the accompanying pages, either independently or together, until they are each satisfied that they are familiar with the TTH and that:
1. the TTH is substantive, i.e. both testable and nontrivial
2. the TTH is novel, i.e. it contains at least one substantive element that they have not previously encountered.

To demonstrate such satisfaction, they should each write down at least one such element. If they are not so satisfied, do not proceed with the test.

At t = baseline, the test is performed using the accompanying Worksheet. A certain amount of time later (between one day and one week later; ideally involving at least one sleep cycle) the test is repeated; this is the "follow up" test. In addition, the Subject will write down the substantive and novel element(s) of the TTH that they previously wrote down during the initial learning phase.

The primary endpoint will be the percentage change in score between the baseline and the follow up test. One or more control hypotheses of similar complexity may be devised for comparison.

The secondary endpoint will be the percentage of Subjects who are unable to remember any substantive and novel elements of the TTH at follow up.

Participants will be paid for participation, with a bonus payment for higher test scores.
