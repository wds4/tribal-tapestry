The following is a hypothetical conversation between Person A, who is familiar with Tribal Tapestry Theory, and Person B, who is not.

B: In a nutshell, what is Tribal Tapestry Theory?

A: For the sake of acceptance, many hold beliefs that are misguided, offensive, or even toxic, and most are unaware because if they were, social cohesion would fail.

B: What do you mean by social cohesion?

A: People naturally coalesce into tribes. The most useful definition of ‘social cohesion’ can be thought of in terms of the tribal narrative: a vast collection of beliefs, values, language, stories, customs, rules, expectations, loosely knit together, that are common to members of the tribe. 

In times of conflict or fear, the ‘narrative’ may include a pattern of behavior known as virtue signaling.

B: What is virtue signaling?

A: A virtue signal is when an individual takes some small thread of the tribal narrative and states or expresses it in a way that is offensive to outsiders. If the thread is not already offensive, he makes it slightly offensive. If it is already slightly offensive, he makes it more so, or even toxic. In times of stress, other tribal members may interpret the virtue signal as a demonstration of loyalty to the tribe.

B: What do you mean by offensive?

A: One of the most direct ways to generate offense is through the insult. The delivery of statements that denigrate or are derogatory. But the most effective insults are more than that; they are also based on reasoning that is clearly untenable. Think of it like a one two punch. Punch number one is the derogatory statement. In and of itself, a derogatory statement may be forgiven if it is judged to be based on solid facts and sound reasoning. Punch number two occurs when the underlying statement or argument is judged to be untenable, in any one of several ways. Perhaps it is founded upon a statement of fact that is unfalsifiable or conflicts with evidence of one’s eyes and ears. Or perhaps it is based on clearly flawed reasoning. Perhaps all of the above. People may understandably feel their intelligence to be insulted if they are expected to believe some idea that is obviously untenable in one of these ways, even if the idea is not derogatory. But it is the one-two punch — the derogatory statement supported by what are obviously untenable facts or logic — that is the basis of an insult that is offensive and that some might feel verges on the toxic. Why would that be? Because the one-two punch is often, understandably, interpreted as evidence of malice.

B: Who decides what facts are untenable or what qualifies as hypocrisy? 

A: The point of a virtue signal is not necessarily to be false in point of fact, or based upon flawed logic in any objective sense. The salient feature of the virtue signal is for the intended target to feel the offense. So the answer to your question is that it is the intended target of the insult who judges.

B: Suppose I want to kick it up a notch. A one-two punch followed by an uppercut to the jaw. Have any suggestions?

A: Do the above, where the insult is a straw-man argument. That means you intentionally misrepresent the state of mind of someone in the opposing tribe. The more obvious the intent to misrepresent, the stronger the offense. Say something like: “I saw you do such-and-such, therefore you are clearly motivated by a bad reason.” 

B: Tell me again why are people engaging in all of this offensive behavior?

A: The fundamental motivation is acceptance. In times of tribal stress, other tribal members may interpret the virtue signal as a demonstration of loyalty to the tribe. In other words, people commit these offenses to satisfy one of their deepest and most understandable needs: to belong.

B: I’m confused. Are you saying that virtue signaling is a good thing or a bad thing?

A: Virtue signaling is a fundamentally selfish act, designed to benefit the individual who engages in the virtue signaling. Whether that is good or bad is up to interpretation.

B: But are you saying people are being intentionally offensive?

A: The offense is by design. It is an integral part of the virtue signal. However: many people, perhaps most, do not think that they’re being offensive. They will tell you they are being virtuous. And the truth is that they are virtuous, as judged by the value system of the tribal narrative.

B: What effect does virtue signaling have on the overall tribal narrative?

A: If a virtue signal proves to be effective for an individual to gain acceptance, that virtue signal may be adopted and imitated by others. In this way, a newly introduced offense spreads throughout the tribe and gains wide acceptance. If the offense includes a logical fallacy or statement of fact that is nonfalsifiable or conflicts with observation, so-called ‘rationalizations’ are invented to justify these untenable ideas that would otherwise be rejected. Whether the rationalization is flimsy or sophisticated, it gets woven into the tribal narrative along with the untenable belief. Over time, these ideas and their rationalizations accumulate, and individuals learn to internalize them or suffer the consequences of loss of status within the tribe. 

B: Tell me again why being offensive equals acceptance by the tribe?

A: It is interpreted as a sign of loyalty to the tribe. 

B: Is this how narratives evolve?

A: It is one way narratives evolve. A single virtue signal shifts the narrative incrementally. But a series of virtue signals over a prolonged period of time can shift the narrative a great deal. These accumulated changes remain, even after the period of virtue signaling is over.

B: What’s the difference between untenable statements of fact on the one hand and logical fallacies on the other?

A: Over time, tribes tend to accumulate offensive threads from each of those two categories, threads which virtuous tribal members are expected to internalize and endorse. Arguably, the former could be labelled ‘right-wing,’ with the latter labelled as ‘left-wing.’  Example of an untenable statement of fact (right wing): our tribe is descended from a great deity. Example of a logical fallacy (left wing): 2 + 2 = 5 (George Orwell, 1984), or equating one thing to its opposite.

B: Doesn’t everyone already know that people are tribal?

A: Most tribal narratives contain some subset of ideas that are unique to the tribe. Most people know this and could provide examples from their own tribe. What most people don’t know is that those ideas were crafted over time specifically for the sake of offending outsiders. They accumulate, not because they can be defended with logic or observation, but specifically because they cannot.






B: So what should we do with this realization?

A: If you care about your tribe, you will learn to recognize your own virtue signaling and will stop. You will learn to identify offending threads that have accumulated over time and excise them. 




A2: People — even highly intelligent ones — embrace logical fallacies and deny the evidence of their eyes and ears, all of which is crafted for the purpose of offending the Other; they are often unaware that they are doing these things, even as they do them; and they do these things because the tribe rewards them for doing so.


B: What does it mean for a virtue signal to be woven into the narrative?

A: It means that an exception must be made. Lines of reasoning are incorporated into the tribal narrative to explain why some particular untenable assertion is in fact tenable, to explain why the data does not contradict the tribal belief, or to explain why some logical fallacy is not a fallacy.





We follow the default rules of cognition in all cases, with the exception of a long list carve outs that have accumulated over time.









B: Where is it written that unfalsifiability, conflict with available data, or logical fallacy are offensive?

A: The vast majority of people naturally consider all of those things to be inherently offensive, regardless of tribal affiliation. We are the product of evolution, which favors those with the ability to create an internal model of reality that is accurate, relevant, and useful. Evolution hardwires for us to be highly sensitive to these things so that we may identify and reject them.





The result is that most individuals find untenable assertions and logical fallacies to be offensive, with the exception of carveouts that have accumulated over time.

B: So why don’t they know they’re being offensive? What explains the blindness?

A: In a nutshell: the best liars are the ones who believe the lies. 

The longer explanation: most individuals find untenable assertions and logical fallacies to be offensive, but not in the strong sense, because these are very abstract concepts. Only in a weak sense. Allegiance to the tribal narrative implies an acceptance of its values and its lines of reasoning, including its carveouts. These carveouts take precedence over abstract notions of nonfalsifiability and logical fallacy.

If toxicity is defined as advocacy of untenable assertions or logical fallacy, many people become advocates of toxicity by design, while being genuinely unaware of this fact.

B: How does this impact society as a whole?

A: Tribal conflict is characterized by hypersensitivity to hypocrisy and untenable beliefs within opposing tribal narratives, while simultaneously blind to the offensive nature of one’s own tribe.

B: So where do we go from here?

A: As neuroscientists and behavioral scientists, it is our duty to describe these patterns of behavior in detail. Of course, academic disciplines are themselves tribes, with accompanying tribal narratives. The theory predicts that we will have difficulty doing so, because it will entail becoming aware of our own tribal toxicity.
