The core hypothesis of this book is called the Dual Cognitive Modes hypothesis and is summarized as follows.

## The Core DCM hypothesis, in one sentence

**The brain of the social animal, including (but not limited to) humans, has two cognitive modes of operation: the *default cognitive mode* and the *social cognitive mode***. 

## Explanation of the core DCM hypothesis

tl/dr: the social mode is defined by its opposition to the default mode; the default mode does whatever the individual deems is worth doing

The two cognitive modes differ in three fundamental ways: why they exist, when they operate, and what they do (or equivalently, how they work).

## Why
- The purpose of the default cognitive mode is to *benefit* the individual [1], where "benefit" is judged by the individual, with no justification or explanation needed.
- The purpose of the social cognitive mode is to gain acceptance by the tribe; to *belong*.

## When
- The default cognitive mode is ALWAYS in control, in EVERY context, by default, UNLESS it is overridden by the social cognitive mode.
- The social cognitive mode overrides the default cognitive mode ONLY when required to do so by the tribal narrative fiction. Since every tribe has its own unique and distinctive narrative fiction, when this mode kicks in is only in very particular, highly specific contexts, SPECIFIC TO THE TRIBE.

## What / How
- default mode: n/a (The core DCM hypothesis does not require us to specify!)
- social mode: demonstrations of loyalty to the tribe by the performance of virtue signals (see below)

## Virtue signals

The purpose of a virtue signal is to broadcast / demonstrate / shout from the mountaintops (to tribal insiders AND outsiders) that the tribal narrative fiction has been woven irreversibly into one's brain.

## Tribal narrative fiction

A collection of toxic threads (see below), woven together, into a pattern that is unique to the tribe. The narrative fiction is a subset of the tribal narrative, which is typically vast and contains many threads which are not necessarily toxic.

## Toxic threads

A toxic thread is defined as one that interferes with the normal functioning of the default cognitive mode. In this way, it exacts a cost or causes harm to the individual, *as judged by the value system of the individual*.

Given these definitions, the strict form of the DCM hypothesis does not require us to specify how or why the default mode works, other than that it benefits the individual in some manner. *The social mode is effectively defined by its opposition to the default mode.*

## Why this system makes sense

Incorporation of a toxic thread into one's psyche is an act of self sacrifice that is hard to fake, hard to undo, and diminishes the feasibility of defecting to enemy tribes. This makes it an effective indicator of tribal loyalty.

The uniqueness of the tribal narrative is essential: it's how we distinguish one tribe from another. Like a uniform or a flag. This is why the imagery of weaving threads into a tapestry is useful. Tapestry theory indicates that the weaving of threads is not some flowery but empty metaphor: it is literal.

## Objective reality

Note that objective reality is not mentioned in the core DCM hypothesis! We do introduce it as an [auxiliary hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/introduction/auxiliaryHypothesis.md), according to which the individual has an internal notion of what some people call "objective reality" and values some version of what some people call "the scientific method." Whether these aspects of the individual's beliefs and value system are "correct" or "right" or "justified" need not be addressed. The only thing that matters is the belief system and the value system of the individual.

[1] I'm not sure whether to add this caveat to the purpose of the default cognitive mode: to benefit the individual in any manner, *except not including the benefits that are already addressed by the social cognitive mode*.
