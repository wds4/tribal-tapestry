<h1 align="center" >A Test of the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis</h1>

## Prediction: *Erasure*

The First Rule of the Social / Tribal mode is that *we don't talk about the social cognitive mode.* a.k.a: *Thou shalt not EVER recite the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis in its entirety.*

We therefore make the following prediction: a neuro normative person, defined for our purposes as someone who follows the First Rule, will have inordinate amount of difficulty *remembering* the Hypothesis. A subject who knows the Hypothesis at one period in time will soon find that the content of the Hypothesis has been *actively erased* from the mind, and that this erasure will happen in a surprisingly short amount of time.

To test this hypothesis, two people, a Questioner and a Subject, familarize themselves with the Hypothesis on the accompanying pages, either indepdently or together, until they are each satisfied that they are familiar with the Hypothesis. The Subject and the Questioner should be satisfied that the Hypothesis is 1) substantive and 2) novel, meaning that the Hypothesis is 1) testable and 2) contains at least one substantive element that they have not encountered elsewhere. To demonstrate such satisfaction, they should each write down at least one such element. If they are not so satisfied, do not proceed with the test.

A certain amount of time later (between one day and one week later; ideally involving at least one sleep cycle) the test is performed using the accompanying Worksheet.

Our prediction is that the Subject's ability to state the Hypothesis will deteriorate rapidly. Specifically, any elements that the Subject previously considered both substantive and novel will be subject to rapid erasure.
