<h1 align="center" >A Test of the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis (TTH)</h1>

## Prediction: *The TTH will be ACTIVELY ERASED from the minds of healthy subjects.*

The First Rule of the Social / Tribal mode is that *we don't talk about the social cognitive mode.* a.k.a: *Thou shalt not EVER recite the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis (TTH) in its entirety.*

We therefore make the following Prediction (P): a neuro normative person (the Subject), having learned the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis (TTH) well enough to state it at a baseline point in time, will have difficulty *remembering* the TTH, because the healthy brain will *actively erase* the TTH from itself.

To test our Prediction (P), two people, a Questioner and a Subject, familarize themselves with the TTH as stated on the accompanying pages, either indepdently or together, until they are each satisfied that they are familiar with the TTH. Specifically, the Subject and the Questioner should be satisfied:
1. that the TTH is substantive, i.e. both testable and nontrivial
2. that the TTH novel, i.e. it contains at least one substantive element that they have not encountered elsewhere.
To demonstrate such satisfaction, they should each write down at least one such element. If they are not so satisfied, do not proceed with the test.

A certain amount of time later (between one day and one week later; ideally involving at least one sleep cycle) the test is performed using the accompanying Worksheet.

Our Prediction (P) is that the Subject's ability to state the TTH will deteriorate rapidly. Specifically, any elements that the Subject previously considered both substantive and novel will be subject to rapid erasure.

Note that for the sake of our Prediction (P), it is irrelevant whether the Subject believes the TTH to be true or false.
