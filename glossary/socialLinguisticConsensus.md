Social Linguistic Consensus
=====

The challenge of *social linguistic consensus* is for a collection of entities to come to consensus on a language in the absence of any centralized authority.

This challenge exists in the biological realm and the digital realm. Ostensibly, the existence of spoken and written word is evidence that SLC has been achieved in the biological realm. However, SLC has *not* been achieved in the digital realm, where digital apps and platforms are reliant upon a variety of centralized stewards.
