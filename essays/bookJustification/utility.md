Utility of the Tribal Tapestry Theory
=====

Our book will lay out vocabulary that will allow you to call out tribal toxicity when you see it. But be forewarned: the same vocabulary can be used against your own tribal toxicity! Are you up to the challenge?

Much of our job will be to create the vocabulary to discuss these ideas, with the realization that the [Prime Directive will be forever at work](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/primeDirectiveHypothesis.md), objecting to the vocabulary, undermining our very ability to have these thoughts. In some cases we will have to settle for vocabulary that some would deem offensive.

=====

If the CTTH is substantive, novel, and true, then surely it will follow that it is useful. It's a friggin' model of knowledge representation in the brain. How could that not be useful?

But more specifically:

## 1. The model is necessary so that we can build the decentralized web. (Doesn't have to be part of the TT book.)

## 2. At the individual level: an understanding of the CTTH will help us to maximize meaning, belonging, and acceptance while minimizing the costs accociated with tribalism. 

- to diagnose pathology internally, from within one's own tribe
- to diagnose pathology in The Other's tribe and inform our decisions regarding how to respond

If my tribe's virtue signaling causes me to piss off potential friends, I should ask: is this worth it?

## 2. May yield insights into normal brain function and brain pathology, including: 

- the function of sleep (see above)
- neurodegenerative dementia: why memory loss is retrograde
- Denial, a form of self deception, does NOT necessarily imply childhood trauma. 

## 3. Ambiguity

Ambiguity is a double-edged sword. In the context of SLC, ambiguity is a strength: it allows two people to have a conversation without requiring them to define every last word infinitely down to the smallest detail, which would probably be impossible. But in the context of Tribal Consensus, ambiguity is turned into a weapon.

## 4. Fun with philosophy.

Postmodernists use ambiguity to build complex arguments that contain logical fallacies so that they can toy with the rest of us as we try to pin down the fallacies, which turns out to be akin to herding cats, because they just tweak the definitions of ambiguously-defined terms in the middle of the "discourse" to move any given fallacy from one place to a different place in their argument.

The reason paradox is deep is because toxicity in service to the tribe is the literal definition of virtue, according to the tribal mode.

Question of the day: is tribal toxicity REALLY necessary? Could we resect it, like the spleen or appendix, and do fine without it? Maybe yes, but only in a world where conflicts were impossible?
