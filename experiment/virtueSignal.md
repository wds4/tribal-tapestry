<h1 align="center" >Virtue Signals: Definition and Description</h1>

# Motivation

The motivaiton of engaging in a virtue signel is to gain acceptance by the tribe.

# Mechanism

One demonstrates loyalty to the tribe via one's response to a virtue signal. In effect, a virtue signal is a litmus test. It is a collection of threads, and one must either endorse them or reject them.

# Components and features
- universally acceptible *core*
- toxic *overlay*
- *union* of the core with the overlay
- the challenge
- calibration

# Standard Binary Responses:

There are two factors to consider when evaluating a subject's 
- Does the subject endorse or reject the virtue signal?
- Does the subject attempt to separate the core from the overlay, or bind them together more tightly?

Virtuous subject: endorse the virtue signal and attempt to bind them together more tightly

the Other: reject the virtue signal

# Nonstandard responses

One potential response that does not fit into either of the above categories and that is worth noting would be the subject who is able to dissect the core and the overlay. 

# Why this makes sense

The purpose of binding the core and the overlay together is to make them effectively a package deal. You are forced to make a choice: endorse the core at the price of endorsing the toxic overlay, or reject the toxic overlay at the price of rejecting the core along with it.
