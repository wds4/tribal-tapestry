Foundations of the Tapestry Theory: List of Hypotheses
=====

## 1. [Let's All Be Friends](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/socialLinguisticConsensusHypothesis.md)
The need for human connection shapes the basic principles of cortical organization.

## 2. ? [Math is the Universal Language]()
The SLC exerts evolutionary pressure for the fundamentals of language to be as universal as possible. Every commitment restricts the universe of entities with which to communicate.

## 3. [Graphs](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/graphHypothesis.md)
Knowledge in the cortex is organized as a graph.

## 4. ? [Nodes can be Anything]()
The SLC exerts pressure to provide the nodes of the tapestry with as much flexibility as possibility in terms of physical structure and data format.

## 5. ? [In the biological realm, nodes are patches of neurons]()
Nodes in the cortex are patches of neurons.

## 6. [Principles of Organization (PoSA](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/principlesOfOrganization.md)
The SLC exerts pressure to make the *principles of organization* of the graph as simple and universal as possible.

## 7. [PoA 1: Class Threads Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/classThreadsHypothesis.md)
Nodes of the graph are organized into sets and concepts using class threads.

## 8. [PoA 2: Constraints Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/constraints.md)
Concepts are formatted according to constraint nodes.

## 9. ? [Integration Hypothesis]()
There is evolutionary pressure for the tapestry to be integrated as tightly and extensively as possible.

## 10. [Vertical Integraion Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/verticalIntegrationHypothesis.md)
Concepts are integrated vertically using the class propagation edge and the class termination edge (2 of the 3 edges that go into the definition of class threads).

## 11. [Object Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/objectHypothesis.md)
Constraint nodes are decomposed into properties in a manner designed to facilitate and maximize horizontal integration of the graph.

## 12. [Normalization Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/normalizationHypothesis.md)
The tapestry is normalized.

## 13. [Optimization Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/optimizationHypothesis.md)
The topology of the tapestry is optimized to increase search efficiency.

## 14. [Theory of Mind Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/theoryOfMindHypothesis.md)
Theory of mind: each tapestry must contain an internal representation (in the form of a concept) of other entities (other people).

## 15. [Web of Trust Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/webOfTrustHypothesis.md)
Decentralized consensus is achieved using Web of Trust.
