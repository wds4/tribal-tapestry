# The Cortical Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis

# Hypotheses

The CTTH is a series of hypotheses, listed below, each of which builds upon the ones before it. The first one is the launching pad.

## Tapestry Foundation

- "Let's all be friends."
- inclusive

### 1. [SLC Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/socialLinguisticConsensus.md): The representation of knowledge in the brain is profoundly influenced by the mandate to facilitate *social linguistic consensus* (SLC).

### 2. [Graph Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/graphHypothesis.md): Knowledge in the cortex is organized as a graph.

### 3. [Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/.md): To achieve SLC, the principles by which structure is imposed over the graph must be as simple and universal as possible.

#### 4. [Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/.md): Nodes of the graph are organized into sets and concepts using class threads.

#### 5. [Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/.md): Concepts are formatted according to constraint nodes.

#### 6. [Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/.md): Concepts are integrated vertically using the class propagation edge and the class termination edge (2 of the 3 edges that go into the definition of class threads).

#### 7. [Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/.md): Constraint nodes are decomposed into properties in a manner designed to facilitate and maximize horizontal integration of the graph.

#### 8. [Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/.md): The tapestry is normalized.

#### 9. [Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/.md): The topology of the tapestry is optimized to increase search efficiency.

#### 10. [Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/.md): Theory of mind: each tapestry must contain an internal representation (in the form of a concept) of other entities (other people).

#### 11. [Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/.md): Decentralized consensus is achieved using Web of Trust.

## Tribal Tapestry 

- "Oh shit, we have enemies."
- exclusion

## 12. [Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/.md): Basic human * cognition employs two distinct modes to arrive at what it considers "truth:" the objective mode and the tribal mode.

## 13. [Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/.md): Toxicity serves a purpose: tribal acceptance.

## 14. [Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/.md): The Enlightenment and postmodernism represent the rejection of the tribal mode and the objective mode, respectively.

## 15. [Hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/.md): The CTTH is universally toxic.
