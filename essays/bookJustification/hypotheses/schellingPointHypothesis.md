### Chapter Title: *The Universal Language*

Math as the universal model for knowledge representation
=====

The mathematics of set theory and graph theory provide the foundation from which language can be constructed.
-----

In the previous section we argued that decentralized linguistic consensus requires two prerequisites: 1) a universal model for knowledge representation and 2) a rudimentary web of trust.
- The universal model must be as simple as possible and devoid of arbitrary decision making about what symbols mean what.
- There must be at least a rudimentary concept of web of trust: the notion that arbitrary decisions will be influenced greatly by, if not completely absorbed from, those around us.

We argue that the only universal language to satisfy those conditions is mathematics. In particular: set theory and graph theory. 

Construction of a language beyond that starting point requires a seemingly endless number of arbitrary decisions that cannot be made without a functioning web of trust.
