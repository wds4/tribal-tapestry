The basic hypothesis of this book will be called the Dual Cognitive Modes hypothesis and will be summarized as follows.

## The DCM hypothesis, in one sentence

The brain of the social animal, including (but not limited to) humans, has two cognitive modes of operation: the *default cognitive mode* and the *social cognitive mode*. 

## Elaboration of the DCM hypothesis

The two cognitive modes differ in three fundamental ways: why they exist, when they operate, and what they do (or equivalently, how they work).

## Why
- The purpose of the default cognitive mode is to *benefit* the individual, *as judged by the value system of the individual*. [1]
- The purpose of the social mode is to gain acceptance by the tribe; to *belong*.

## When
- The default mode is active always, by default, UNLESS it is overridden by the social mode.
- The social mode overrides the default mode ONLY when required to do so by the tribal narrative fiction. Since every tribe has its own unique and distinctive narrative fiction, when this mode kicks in is HIGHLY CONTEXTUAL.

## What
- default mode: n/a [1]
- social mode: demonstrations of loyalty to the tribe by performance of virtue signals

## Virtue signals

The purpose of a virtue signal is to BROADCAST (to tribal insiders AND outsiders) the internalization of the tribal narrative fiction.

## Tribal narrative fiction

A collection of toxic threads, woven together, into a pattern that is unique to the tribe

## Toxic threads

A toxic thread is defined as one that impairs the normal functioning of the default cognitive. "Toxic" = toxic to the default cognitive mode. 

Given these definitions, the strict form of the DCM hypothesis does not require us to specify how or why the default mode works, other than that it benefits the individual in some manner. *The social mode is defined by its opposition to the default mode.*

## Why this system makes sense

Incorporation of a toxic thread into one's psyche is an act of self sacrifice that is hard to fake, hard to undo, and diminishes the feasibility of defecting to enemy tribes. This makes it an effective indicator of tribal loyalty; not a perfect indicator, but arguably the best indicator that there is.

## Don't Know Thyself

An auxiliary hypothesis of this book is the Prime Directive, which is to deny the full extent of the social cognitive mode in oneself and in one's tribe, despite an exquisite sensitivity to its presence in The Other. In other words, be ignorant of the dual hypothesis. The primary method is to erase the very words that are used to communicate the hypothesis. Adherence to the Prime Directive is neuro-normative behaviour, while Deviation from the Primae Directive is one form of neuroatypical.

## Notes

[1] We add an *auxiliary* hypothesis that this is how and why the default cognitive mode works: its purpose is to confer survival benefit to the individual by maintaining a representation of the world on that is *accurate and relevant*. It does this through reliance on observation, consistency, rules of logic; what some humans would call "the scientific method."
