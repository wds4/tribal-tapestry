The Prime Directive Hypothesis
=====

Tribal Tapestry theory is universally toxic. Perhaps uniquely so!
-----

I used *the Prime Directive* to refer to the mandate that we must all believe that toxicity apples to The Other's tribe but NEVER to MY tribe, but you did not like this name and I can never remember what name we replaced it with! What was it??

The reason the Cortical-Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis (CTTH) remains absent from the neuroscience literature because the CTTH is toxic to everyone. The CTTH exists firmly within everyone's cognitive blond spot, as evidenced by the difficulty of finding vocabulary even to state the hypothesis that is not immediately rejected as pejorative, insulting, etc. There is no non-pejorative terminology for: toxic, objective versus tribal mindset, narrative fiction. The words that are used to formulate the hypothesis are deemed objectionable. George Orwell observed that you can think about something if you don't have the right words.

*The CTTH explains why you've never heard of the CTTH.*

"Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it."
-- George Orwell, 1984

In the case of the CTTH, when the following words are used in the context of CTTH, the words themselves are deemed objectionable, rendering it impossible to state the CTTH, to have a conversation about it, and to carry it all the way to its conclusion.
- toxicity (who decides what's toxic?!?)
- narrative fiction (but what you call fiction is my lived experience!)
- objective reality (any discussion of objective reality is patronizing)
- the Prime Directive (huh?)
