Prologue: A Butterfly's Dream
=====

You are going to see a lot of talk about *toxicity* and *objective reality* in this book. In these pages, you will witness the Champion of the Enlightenment, Da Vinci and the Champion of Postmodernism, Derrida, clash like knights of a medieval kingdom. Perhaps you follow Ayn Rand, and like a good objectivist, you believe in objective reality. Real is real. A equals A.

But ... perhaps that view is not satisfying to you. What if you're not sure that you believe in objective reality? What if you take a slighlty different view that reality, the laws of physics are what the Bible means by the Word of God? What if you agree with Elon Musk, that there is a good chance we are living in a simulation? What if you wonder whether we might be living within the dream of a butterfly? 

We do not answer those questions. And we do not require you to commit to any one of those views over the others. 

This book is a theory about how the brain of the social animal works. We hypothesize that the brain has two modes of arriving at what the brain considers to be a working definition of "the truth:" the default cognitive mode and the tribal cognitive mode. These modes are defined, NOT in terms of whether the results of their deliberations are ACTUALLY True or False, but in terms of their methodologies. The default cognitive mode comprises one set of methods that the brain employs all the time and in all contexts, by default, unless it gets overridden by the tribal mode. The default cognitive mode relies upon observation and employs logic. It rejects statements of fact that are contradicted by observation. It rejects unfalsifiable assertions on the grounds that they are unfalsifiable. It rejects reasoning that it considers to be based on logical fallacy.

The default mode is used all the time, in all contexts, EXCEPT when the tribal cognitive mode overrides it. This happens only in very specific, very particular contexts that depend very much upon the tribe in question. From time to time, the rules of society require us to demonstrate our allegiance to the tribe by endorsing the tribal narrative fiction. By definition, the narrative fiction is a tapestry built out of toxic threads. And by definition, a toxic thread is one that would be rejected by anyone external to the tribe. In other words, a toxic thread is one that would be rejected by the standard practices of the default cognitive mode. Incorporation of a toxic thread into one's psyche is an act of self sacrifice that is hard to fake and hard to undo, which is why it can serve as an indicator of tribal loyalty.

The tribal cognitive mode is designed specifically to oppose the default cognitive mode, and to do so only when it is specifically required to do so. Nonfalsifiable beliefs go unchallenged. Logical fallacies are embraced. But ONLY in service to the tribal narrative fiction. Not in any other context.

The above model explains why virtually no one would object to the claim that cyanide is poisonous or to the admonition to look both ways before crossing the street. No one interjects whether Reality is Real in contexts like these. Why? Because you don't want to die of poison or of being hit by a car, and your tribe doesn't require you to set aside the default cognitive mode in either of these contexts.

Toxicity -- not Truth -- is the glue that holds tribes together.
