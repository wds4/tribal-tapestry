# The Cortical Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis

# Abstract 

Before we (USS and WDS4) can proceed with our celebrated Oprah Book Club selection and NYT Best Seller, *The Tribal Tapestry*, we must first come to an agreement as to 1) what the Cortical Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis actually states and 2) whether it is well formulated, novel, plausibly true, and useful. If it does not meet ALL of those requirements, it means we have nothing new to say and there is no sense writing the book – unless we want to be charlatans, repackaging tired old ideas in a new wrapper, which neither one of us wants to do. Whether or not we present the full hypothesis in all its glorious detail in the book is another matter. Some parts may be too dry and boring. But leaving it out of the book doesn't mean we don't need to discuss it first. Because there’s no way to decide which parts to include without first coming to agreement on the model itself. Below, I present the model as a series of hypotheses, each of which layer upon the ones before it.

# The Claim

I claim that the CTTH is all of the following.

- well formulated: a coherent theory that is substantive and falsifiable
- novel: none (with maybe a few pseudo-exceptions) of the 15 hypotheses below exist in the literature
- plausible
- useful

# Counterclaim

- not substantive
- not novel
- implausible
- not useful

# Hypotheses

The CTTH is a series of hypotheses, listed below, each of which builds upon the ones before it. The first one is the launching pad.

## 1. The representation of knowledge in the brain is profoundly influenced by the mandate to facilitate *social linguistic consensus* (SLC).

## 2. Knowledge in the cortex is organized as a graph.

## 3. To achieve SLC, the principles by which structure is imposed over the graph must be as simple and universal as possible.

## 4. Nodes of the graph are organized into sets and concepts using class threads.
