<h1 align="center" >Virtue Signals: Definition and Description</h1>

# Motivation

The motivaiton of engaging in a virtue signel is to gain acceptance by the tribe.

# Mechanism

One demonstrates loyalty to the tribe via one's response to a virtue signal. In effect, a virtue signal is a litmus test. It is a collection of threads, and one must either endorse them or reject them.

# Components and features
### Primary
- a universally acceptible *core* (ideas, values, etc that most or all people would agree with, regardless of tribal affiliation)
- a toxic *overlay* (e.g. hypocrisy or unfalsifiable assertions of fact)
- the *union* of the core with the overlay (an argument that acceptance of the core and the overlay are a package deal. This argument is included within the toxic overlay.)

### Secondary
- the challenge (an individual demonstrates acceptance or rejection of the VS)
- calibration (acceptance of the overlay needs to incur a cost that is not too high and not too low, the determination of which is encoded into the tribal narrative fiction; analogous to the *difficulty adjustment* of the proof of work consensus mechanism)

# Standard Binary Responses:

There are two factors to consider when evaluating a subject's response to the challenge.
- Does the subject endorse or reject the virtue signal?
- Does the subject attempt to separate the core from the overlay, or bind them together more tightly?

The virtuous subject endorses the virtue signal and resists any attempt to disentabgle the core and the overlay.

The Other rejects the virtue signal; may attempt to unravel the core and the overlay, so that the core can be accepted while the overlay is rejected.

# Nonstandard responses

One potential response that does not fit into either of the above categories and that is worth noting would be the subject who is able to unravel the core and the overlay. This is nonstandard because virtue signals are designed to make this very hard to do. The abaility to do this successfully generaly requires preparation and advanced and detailed knowledge of the virtue signal and the tribal tapestry in which it is embedded.

# Why this makes sense

The purpose of binding the core and the overlay together is to make them effectively a package deal. You are forced to make a choice: endorse the core at the price of endorsing the toxic overlay, or reject the toxic overlay at the price of rejecting the core along with it.
