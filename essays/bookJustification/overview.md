# The Cortical Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis

# Abstract 

Before we can proceed with our top-pick Oprah Book List and NYT Best Seller, The Tribal Tapestry, we must first come to an agreement as to 1) what the Cortical Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis actually states and 2) whether it is well formulated, novel, plausibly true, and useful. If it does not meet ALL of those requirements, it means we have nothing new to say and there is no sense writing the book – unless we want to be charlatans, repackaging tired old ideas in a new wrapper, which neither one of us wants to do. Whether or not we present the full hypothesis in all its glorious detail in the book is another matter. Some parts may be too dry and boring. But there’s no way to decide which parts to include without first coming to agreement on the model itself. Below, I present the model as a series of hypotheses, each of which layer upon the ones before it.
