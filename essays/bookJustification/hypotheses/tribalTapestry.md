Tribal Tapestry
=====

# List of Hypotheses

## 1. [Oh Shit, We Have Enemies.](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/humanConditionHypothesis.md)
The human condition -- the fact that we have enemies -- drives a new twist in how the brain operates.

## 2. [Exclusion is necessary.]()
The formation of tribes requires rejection of The Other.

## 2. [The Tribal Narrative Fiction.]()
Tribes are defined by tribal narratives, and distinguished by the Narrative Fiction.

## 3. [Proof of Loyalty]()
Toxicity serves a purpose: proof of loyalty to the tribe.

## 3. [Virtue Signals]()
Virtue Signals demonstrate proof of loyalty and weave toxic threads into the narrative fiction.

## 4. [There's Truth, and Then There's Truth.](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/dualModeHypothesis.md)
Basic human cognition employs two distinct modes to arrive at what it considers "truth:" the objective mode and the tribal mode.

## 5. [Da Vince versus Derrida](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/postmodernismHypothesis.md)
The Enlightenment and postmodernism represent the rejection of the tribal mode and the objective mode, respectively.

## 6. [That Which Shall Not Be Named](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/primeDirectiveHypothesis.md)
Tribal Tapestry Theory is universally toxic; the Prime Directive commands us to erase the vocabulary required to discuss it.
