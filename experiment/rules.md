<h1 align="center" >The Rules of the Social Mode</h1>

The social mode is enabled by (alternatively, *is defined as*) the following set of rules. This list is in draft form and likely incomplete. The context-dependent application of these rules (with the possible exception of the first rule, which is context-independent) is the key to the recognition of their existence.

## First Rule (_Blind Spot_)

We don't talk about the social mode.

Alternative statement 1: We don't acknowledge the existence of the social mode.

Alternative statement 2: We are UNAWARE of the existence of the social mode.

Alternative statement 3: Thou shalt never recite (or tolerate the recitation of) the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis.

## Second Rule (_What is Reality, Anyway_)

The *problematization* of the notion of objective reality (in the abstract) is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

## Third Rule (_Straw Man_)

Misrepresentation of the state of mind of The Other and or of The Self is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

## Third Rule, corollary (_Projection_)

Projection of one own's tribal toxicity onto The Other is a virtue when in service to the tribe.

## Fourth Rule (_Equivocation_)

Logical fallacy via equivocation is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

## Fifth Rule (_Problematization_)

The *problematization* of words, ideas or concepts is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction. The effect of this rule is to render people unanable to communicate or even to think certain thoughts by removing from their brains the words that would enable them to do so.

## Sixth Rule (_Messenger versus the Message_)

When in the standard mode, the content of the message is more relevant than the tribal identity of the messenger. When in the tribal mode, the reverse is true.

# Definitions

- equivocation: the strategic and surreptitious switching between two (or more) definitions of a word, phrase, or concept, within the context of a single argument or line of thought
- problematization: ranges from *misinterpretation* of words, thoughts and ideas to the downright objection to the usage or even the very existence of a particular word, phrase or concept on the grounds that virtuous people would not use it or think it
