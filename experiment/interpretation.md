<h1 align="center" >A Test of the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis: Interpretation</h1>

## the neuro normative response
According to the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis, a neuro normative person will be either unwilling or unable to pass the test, and will be unable to state anything that is not already commmon knowledge to the Oprah audience. We predict frequent outcomes to be one of the following:

1. *Refusal to take the test because of rEaSoNs.*

2. An abbreviated response:
- [ ] people are tribal, and that's bad, and we should do better

In case of 2, the Questioner may prompt the following questions:
1. What are the two cognitive modes?
2. How do they differ?
3. How do you define: Tribal Narrative, Narrative Fiction, Toxicity?
4. What is the First Rule?
5. What are the rest of the Rules?

# Comments

A more thorough testing protocol would include a control theory of comparable complexity. The prediction would be that the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis will be actively erased over some time period during which the control theory is not erased.
