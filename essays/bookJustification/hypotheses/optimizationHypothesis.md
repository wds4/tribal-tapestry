Optimization Hypothesis
=====

The topology of the tapestry is optimized to increase search efficiency.
-----

Organization of the graph lends itself well to the algorithmic search for similarity in graphical topology between disparate regions,a.k.a. analogies, as well as other processes that well merit the label: thinking. However, such searches will be computationally very expensive. Background processing to optimize the tapestry for such searches will be important, and could be an important role for nonREM sleep.

An example of graph optimization: an isASubsetOf edge between Dogs and Fido would be redundant. Removal of that edge could potentially impact the computational efficiency of path searches.
