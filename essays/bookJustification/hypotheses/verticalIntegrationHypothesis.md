Vertical Integration Hypothesis
=====

Concepts are integrated vertically using the class propagation edge and the class termination edge (2 of the 3 edges that go into the definition of class threads).

-----

See Figure 1, below. The concept of Irish Setter is integrated vertically to the concept of Dog Breed (path termination edge, red arrow) and to the concept of Dog (path propagation edge, grey arrow). Note that the interpretations of these two edge types (isASubsetOf and isASpecificInstanceOf, see above) remain intact.
