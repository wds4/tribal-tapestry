Normalization Hypothesis
=====

The tapestry is normalized.

-----

Normalization means that every node is unique. The concept of normalization of a database is familiar to computer scientists and database engineers. Sometimes normalization is broken, and that happens in the CTTH, but there must always be a reason for breaking it. In the CTTH, normalization is likely broken for data redundancy (so you don't forget something important when you bump your head and microinfarct a single cortical column). See *The Thousand Brains Hypothesis* -- a very interesting book. Other reasons to break normalization also exist: multiple versions of the same node facilitate the opportinuty to experiment with minor variations to a given concept.
