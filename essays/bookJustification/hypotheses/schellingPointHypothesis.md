### Chapter Title: *The Universal Language*

Math as the universal model for knowledge representation
=====

Mathematics of set theory and graph theory provide the universal starting set of assumptions about how knowledge is represented.
-----

The basic starting point of tapestry theory is that decentralized linguistic consensus requires two prerequisites: 1) a universal model for knowledge representation and 2) web of trust.
- The universal model must be as simple as possible and devoid of arbitrary decision making about what symbols mean what.
- There must be at least a rudimentary concept of web of trust: the notion that arbitrary decisions will be influenced greatly by, if not completely absorbed from, those around us.

We argue that the only universal language to satisfy those conditions is mathematics. In particular: set theory and graph theory. 

Progression beyond the starting point requires arbitrary decisions which cannot be made without a functioning web of trust. 

Language requires consensus on the arbitrary symbols that a community uses to represent knowledge. But before consensus can be established, there must be two things: a starting point, springboard, schelling point from which to start; and a WoT. The Tapestry Foundation describes how that comes into place.
