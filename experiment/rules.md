<h1 align="center" >The Rules of the Social Mode</h1>

The social mode is enabled by (alternatively, *is defined as*) the following set of rules. Each rule defines a feature of cognition that is a _virtue_ when in service to one's own tribal narrative fiction, but that would otherwise be classified by the standard mode as a _vice_. These rules have been enumerated based on simple observation of human behaviour, with social media being a particularly rich source of data.

The key to the recognition of the existence of these rules is their *context-dependent application*, always being applied relative to the narrative fiction of one's own tribe (with the possible exception of the First Rule, which seems to be context-independent.)

The list is in draft form and likely incomplete. Some rules overlap with others. 

## First Rule

We don't talk about the social mode.

Alternative statement 1: We don't acknowledge the existence of the social mode.

Alternative statement 2: We are UNAWARE of the existence of the social mode.

Alternative statement 3: Thou shalt never recite (or tolerate the recitation of) the Tribal Tapestry Hypothesis.

## _Attention_

The *studious inattention* towards data that conflicts with the tribal narrative is a virtue. Conversely, the *selective attention* towards data that supports the tribal narrative is a virtue.

## _Logical fallacy_

Logical fallacy, a.k.a. _hypocrisy_, in service to one's own tribal narrative is a virtue.

## _Reality_

The *problematization* of the notion of objective reality (in the abstract) is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

## _Hypersensitivity_

A strong hypersensitivity of the inherent toxicity (e.g. hypocrisy, studious inattention, etc) of the tribal narrative fiction of the Other, accompanied by a lack of conscious awareness of the inherent toxicity of one's own tribal narrative fiction, is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

## _Theory of Mind_

Misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the state of mind of The Other (including the tribal narrative of the Other) and / or of The Self is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

## _Projection_

Projection of Vice, _as defined by the value system of one's own tribe_, onto The Other is a virtue when in service to the tribe.

## _Equivocation_

Logical fallacy via equivocation is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction.

## _Misinterpretation / Problematization_

The misinterpretation or *problematization* of words, ideas or concepts is a virtue when in service to the tribal narrative fiction. The effect of this rule is to render people unanable to communicate or even to think certain thoughts by removing from their brains the words that would enable them to do so.

## _Messenger versus the Message_

When in the standard mode, the content of the message is more important than the tribal identity of the messenger. When in the tribal mode, it's the other way around.

# Definitions

- equivocation: the strategic and surreptitious switching between two (or more) definitions of a word, phrase, or concept, within the context of a single argument or line of thought
- problematization: ranges from *misinterpretation* of words, thoughts and ideas to the downright objection to the usage or even the very existence of a particular word, phrase or concept on the grounds that virtuous people would not use it or think it
