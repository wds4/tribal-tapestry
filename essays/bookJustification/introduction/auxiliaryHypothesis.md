back to the [core DCM hypothesis](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/tree/main/essays/bookJustification/introduction)

Auxiliary Hypothesis to the Core Dual Cognitive Mode hypothesis
===

We add an *auxiliary* hypothesis to the core DCM hypothesis, which is that the purpose of the default cognitive mode is this: to confer survival benefit to the individual by maintaining a representation of the world that is both relevant and *objectively true*. It does this through reliance on observation, logical consistency, rules of logic, etc; what some humans would call "the scientific method." Note that it doesn't have to be the real, actual objective truth. The only thing that matters is that the individual believes in it.

A corollary to the auxiliary DCM hypothesis is that the toxic threads that make up the tribal narrative fiction would consist primarily of logical fallacies, nonfalsifiable statements, and observably false statements, woven into a pattern that is unique to the tribe. The social cognitive mode, which is defined to be in opposition to the default cognitive mode, would be expected to weave this pattern into the individual's brain and to advertise this fact through virtue signals.

## Objective truth

Objective truth refers to the truth according to whatever reality is accessible to us, whether that be a simulation, a butterfly's dream, or something else. Objective truth does NOT refer to the deeper, underlying truth that is not accessible to us ... assuming one exists (which is unknowable, by definition).

## Don't Know Thyself

Another auxiliary hypothesis of this book is the Prime Directive, which is the directive to deny and be unaware of the full extent of the social cognitive mode in oneself and in one's tribe, despite an exquisite sensitivity to its presence in The Other. In other words, to be ignorant of the DCM hypothesis (core + auxiliary). The primary method is to erase the very words that are used to communicate the hypothesis, as exemplified by the idea that reference to objective reality is patronizing or in some way a bad thing. Adherence to the Prime Directive is neuro-normative behaviour, while deviation from the Prime Directive is one way of being neuroatypical.

The Prime Directive makes sense: Any strategy that can minimize the damage of the narrative fiction to the default cognitive mode will be implemented. The social mode requires us to contradict objective reality, which means we have to lie, and there is literature that self-deception can decrease the cognitve cost of lying. IOW, the best liar is one who believes the lie.

## additional remarks

*Make note of the fact that the core DCM hypothesis introduces the concepts of narrative fiction and toxicity but does so in a manner that requires NO reference or mention whatsoever of objective reality, the scientific method, falsifiability, logic, hypocrisy, etc. These don't come in until we add the auxiliary hypothesis. But even without the auxiliary hypothesis, there is substance to be found within the core DCM hypothesis.*
