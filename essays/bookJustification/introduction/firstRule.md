One of the most important tasks will be to find an alternate name for the Prime Directive.

Proposal: rename the social cognitive mode.

two modes: 
- the default cognitive mode; standard mode;
- the anti-default cognitive mode; the reverse default mode; backwards mode; anti-standard mode; reverse-standard mode; the Upside Down mode; self-sacrificial mode; toxicity mode; virtue mode

Rename the Prime Directive:

First Rule of the Reverse Standard Mode.

The first rule of the Reverse Default mode: we don't talk about the reverse default mode.

**Zeroth** rule of Toxicity: We don't _think_ about toxicity. Equivalently: we don't talk about the First Rule.

Whenever someone discusses toxicity in particular, or the Dual Cognitive Mode hypothesis in general, the First Rule will compel you to end the discussion. The preferred method is to challenge the words that we use to have the discussion.
1. object on moral grounds -- "who are you to say that" --  "you're being pandering" -- "it's immoral to say what you said, so: quit it."
2. Alter the definitions of one or more words with the goal of rendering the statements empty, devoid of content. Take a substantive statement and make it not substantive. Nothing new under the sun. -- "you're not saying anything new here"

Either method is designed to derail the discussion, to prevent discussing the ideas, and to prevent thinking the ideas.

The pushback that you're giving me -- the neuro-normaitve readers are going to give the exact same pushback. It's important for us to know what it is. But if you want to write this book, you have to learn to disobey the First Rule of Toxicity. That will cause discomfort. You have to have the courage to lean into your discomfort.

The definitions of words are determined by how we use them. WHen I use the word discomfort: you might object to the word; or you might interpret it using a definition that gives you an excuse NOT to acknowledge the truth of my observation.

If we're going to write a book, you need to learn to disobey the First Rule of Toxicity. Why should you do that? bc the act of writing this book is an act of rebellion against the First Rule. So if you don't, it will be impossible to write this book. 

One of the prerequisites for neuro-normative behaviour is a healthy respect for the First Rule. The act of writing (or reading or talking about or thinking about) this book is an act of rebellion against the First Rule.

No one goes down this rabbit hole without kicking and screaming. Unless you're just the right amount of neuro atypical.
