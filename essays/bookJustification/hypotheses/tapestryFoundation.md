The Foundations of Tapestry Theory
=====

## 1. [Decentralized Linguistic Consensus](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/decentralizedLinguisticConsensusHypothesis.md)
The need for decentralized linguistic consensus (DLC) determines the basic structure of knowledge representation.

## 2. [The Universal Language](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/schellingPointHypothesis.md)
The SLC exerts evolutionary pressure for the fundamentals of language to be as inclusive and universal as possible. Every commitment restricts the universe of entities with which to communicate.

## 3. [Knowledge is organized into Graphs](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/graphHypothesis.md)
Knowledge in the cortex is organized as a graph.

Could merge 1-3: 
Mathematics is the schelling point to begin the decentralized representation of knowledge (decentralized language).
Or: Decentralied linguistic consensus cannot begin without a schelling point. Math provides that schelling point.

Decentralized language requires two things: some sort of schelling point from which to start, and a WoT.

Progression beyond the starting point requires arbitrary decisions which cannot be made without a functioning web of trust.
Language requires consensus on the arbitrary symbols that a community uses to represent knowledge. But before consensus can be established, there must be two things: a starting point, springboard, schelling point from which to start; and a WoT. The Tapestry Foundation describes how that comes into place.

## 4. [Free to be You and Me](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/nodeFlexibilityHypothesis.md)
The SLC exerts pressure to provide the nodes of the tapestry with as much flexibility as possibility in terms of physical structure and data format.

## 5. [In the biological realm, nodes are patches of neurons](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/biologicalNodesAreNeuronsHypothesis.md)
Nodes in the cortex are patches of neurons.

## 6. [Principles of Organization (PoA)](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/principlesOfOrganization.md)
The SLC exerts pressure to make the *principles of organization* of the graph as simple and universal as possible.

## 7. [PoA 1: Class Threads](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/classThreadsHypothesis.md)
Nodes of the graph are organized into sets and concepts using class threads.

## 8. [PoA 2: Pattern Recognition](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/constraints.md)
Concepts are formatted according to constraint nodes.

## 9. [Information Integration](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/integrationMaximizationHypothesis.md)
There is evolutionary pressure for the tapestry to be integrated as tightly and extensively as possible.

## 10. [Vertical Integration](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/verticalIntegrationHypothesis.md)
Concepts are integrated vertically using the class propagation edge and the class termination edge (2 of the 3 edges that go into the definition of class threads).

## 11. [Horizontal Integration](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/objectHypothesis.md)
Constraint nodes are decomposed into properties in a manner designed to facilitate and maximize horizontal integration of the graph.

## 12. [The Nodal versus the Topological Data Layers](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/dualDataLayersHypothesis.md)
Information is stored in two layers: the nodal layer and the topological layer. Each layer has relative advantages and disadvantages over the other in terms of efficiency of data search, data processing, and information retrieval, the appreciation of which is crucial for development of the tribal narrative.

## 13. [Normalization](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/normalizationHypothesis.md)
The tapestry is normalized.

## 14. [Optimization](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/optimizationHypothesis.md)
The topology of the tapestry is optimized for search efficiency and other parameters. This probably occurs on a periodic basis and may be the primary function of sleep.

## 15. [Theory of Mind](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/theoryOfMindHypothesis.md)
Theory of mind: each tapestry must contain an internal representation (in the form of a concept) of other entities (other people).

## 16. [Ambiguity](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/ambiguityHypothesis.md)
A high tolerance for ambiguity of meaning is one of the hallmarks of the tapestry method.

## 17. [Superposition of language and knowledge](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/superpositionOfLanguage.md)
The layering of language and of knowledge is another of the hallmarks of the tapestry method.

## 18. [Web of Trust](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/webOfTrustHypothesis.md)
Decentralized consensus is achieved using Web of Trust.
