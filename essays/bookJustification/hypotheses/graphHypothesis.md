### Essay Title: *It's Graphs All the Way Down*

The Graph Hypothesis
=====

Knowledge in the cortex is organized as a graph.
-----

Knowledge is broken down into small chunks, called nodes, and organized into a graph. This is not exactly controversial or new. It's hard to imagine that this is NOT the case. But it's the launching pad for subsequent hypotheses.

Knowledge is represented in two layers: the *nodal layer* and the *topological layer*. First and foremost, the tapestry method is concerned with the principles of organization of the topological layer. Conversely, the tapestry method places no restrictions on the physical form and data format of individual nodes. In the biological realm, nodes are patches of neurons: cortical columns, cortical minicolumns, nuclei, or other structures. In the digital realm, a node is a digital file: a data file, an image file, anything. 

There are important differences between information storage between these two methods. The topological layer can store information more efficiently and is well suited as a means to search for patterns, discover new relationships, and generate hypotheses. However, information retrieval is much more efficient (faster) from the nodal layer. Much of the brain's "up time" is likely spent updating the graph with new information. Much of the brain's "down time" (sleep?) is likely spent on 1) the coputationally expensive process of mining the graph for data, the results of which can be stored in nodes, and 2) optimizations of graphical topology. I say this based on my experience applying the tapestry method in the digital realm.
